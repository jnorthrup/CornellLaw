### commentary on ## § 1-101. Short Titles.


The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), hereafter referred to as the "Act", is a comprehensive set of laws governing commercial transactions in the United States. It aims to standardize business laws across all 50 states in order to facilitate commerce. 

The General Provisions, referred to as the "article", set forth the general principles and definitions that apply throughout the rest of the UCC. 

The Act is not without its critics, some of whom may consider it an overreach of federal authority into areas traditionally governed by state law. Others may critique it for its complexity and occasional ambiguity. Despite these concerns, the UCC remains a vital tool for businesses, lawyers, and courts in handling commercial transactions. 

Significant events in the timeline of the UCC include its first publication in 1952, its widespread adoption by the late 1960s, and its ongoing revision and modernization to keep pace with changes in business practices. 

The UCC is often compared to other significant legal codes, like the Restatement of the Law, another influential uniform law guide, and the Napoleonic Code, one of the earliest attempts at a comprehensive legal code. It is also a common reference point in discussions of commercial law in other jurisdictions, including the European Union's Civil Code and Canada's Personal Property Security Act.

This section essentially states that the provisions contained within this particular article of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) will apply to transactions, as long as those transactions are also subject to other articles within the UCC. This would serve to prevent any potential conflicts or inconsistencies between different parts of the UCC, ensuring that the entire code works together as a cohesive whole.

## § 1-103. Construction of Uniform Commercial Code to Promote its Purposes and Policies: Applicability of Supplemental Principles of Law.


Primary tabs







(a) The Uniform Commercial Code must be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies, which are: (1) to simplify, clarify, and modernize the law governing commercial transactions; (2) to permit the continued expansion of commercial practices through custom, usage, and agreement of the parties; and (3) to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.(b) Unless displaced by the particular provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, and other validating or invalidating cause supplement its provisions.

### commentary on ## § 1-103. Construction of Uniform Commercial Code to Promote its Purposes and Policies: Applicability of Supplemental Principles of Law.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) highlights the overarching approach and purpose of the UCC. It calls for a liberal interpretation and application of the UCC to achieve its underlying goals. These goals include: modernizing and simplifying commercial transaction law, allowing for the growth of commercial practices through custom and agreement, and creating a uniform law across different jurisdictions.

In essence, this section aims to ensure that the UCC is adaptable to different situations and can accommodate evolving business practices. It also emphasizes the goal of achieving consistency in commercial transaction laws across different states or jurisdictions.

The second part of this section clarifies that the UCC does not supersede other principles of law and equity, such as the law merchant (or commercial law), contract law, agency law, and laws concerning fraud, duress, mistake, bankruptcy, among others. These principles of law can still be applied in conjunction with the UCC, unless a specific provision of the UCC overrides them.

## § 1-104. Construction Against Implied Repeal.


Primary tabs







The Uniform Commercial Code being a general act intended as a unified coverage of its subject matter, no part of it shall be deemed to be impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation if such construction can reasonably be avoided.

§ 1-105. Severability. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-104. Construction Against Implied Repeal.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) essentially states that no part of the UCC should be considered repealed or overridden by later legislation unless there is no reasonable way to avoid this interpretation. This is because the UCC is a comprehensive law created to unify and cover all aspects of commercial transactions. This also suggests that the UCC should be the primary reference in matters of commercial transactions, unless new laws explicitly state otherwise.

For instance, if a new law is passed regarding commercial transactions, this section indicates that it should not be assumed that this new law repeals or changes any part of the UCC, unless the new law clearly states that it does so or there is no reasonable way to interpret the new law without assuming that it changes the UCC. 

This provides stability and predictability for commercial transactions, since businesses and individuals can trust that the rules set out in the UCC will remain consistent unless explicitly changed. It also strongly encourages any new legislation to be specific and clear about how it interacts with the UCC, to avoid any confusion or ambiguity.

In simple terms, the UCC has "dibs" on commercial transactions, and any new laws must make it clear if they're trying to change that.

## § 1-105. Severability.


Primary tabs







If any provision or clause of the Uniform Commercial Code or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Uniform Commercial Code which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code are severable.

§ 1-106. Use of Singular and Plural; Gender. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-105. Severability.


The "Severability" clause of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) essentially means that the UCC is like a giant puzzle; if one piece (or provision) is deemed invalid, the rest of the puzzle (or code) still stands. This clause ensures that the entire UCC does not get thrown out if a court rules a particular provision invalid. It's like saying, "Just because you don't like one song on an album, doesn't mean you have to throw away the entire CD." 

This article doesn't have any significant timeline events or commonly referred counterparts. However, it's quite common in legal documents to have a severability clause included. The clause provides a safety net for the other provisions in case one is found to be invalid or unenforceable. 

Next up is § 1-106 which deals with the use of singular and plural, as well as gender in the UCC. It's like the code's way of saying, "When we say 'he', we also mean 'she' and 'they', and when we say 'it', we could also mean 'them'." It's a linguistic clarification to avoid any misunderstanding.

## § 1-106. Use of Singular and Plural; Gender.


Primary tabs







In the Uniform Commercial Code, unless the statutory context otherwise requires: (1) words in the singular number include the plural, and those in the plural include the singular; and (2) words of any gender also refer to any other gender.

§ 1-107. Section Captions.  ›







### commentary on ## § 1-106. Use of Singular and Plural; Gender.


This section in Uniform Commercial Code states that, unless specified otherwise by the law, any word mentioned in singular form can also be interpreted in plural form, and vice versa. Similarly, any gender-specific term can also be referred to any other gender. It basically promotes an all-inclusive language approach in law, essentially making sure that legal interpretations are not restricted by the numbers or gender of words. This provides flexibility in understanding law and ensures its application to a broad range of scenarios. 

For example, if the code mentions "seller", it can be referred to both a single person selling an item and multiple people selling items. Likewise, words like "he" or "she" can also be interpreted as "they" or vice versa, making the law applicable to all genders.

This is part of the Uniform Commercial Code's effort to be as universally applicable and nondiscriminatory as possible.

### commentary on ## § 1-107. Section Captions. 


The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a comprehensive set of laws governing all commercial transactions in the United States. This particular section, § 1-107, provides that section captions, or titles, are part of the UCC. This means that the headings used to identify and organize the various sections of the UCC have legal significance and are not merely editorial or for convenience.

An analogy might be how a book's chapter titles are not just for easy navigation, but can also convey important information about the content of the chapter.

This provision, while straightforward, is important because it underscores the comprehensive and detailed nature of the UCC, wherein even section headings have legal weight. 

There are no significant timeline events related to this section as it is a universal and consistent element of the UCC across time and jurisdictions.

In broader context, this section is paired with other sections dealing with interpretation and usage, such as § 1-106 (Use of Singular and Plural; Gender) and § 1-108 (Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act), together providing guidance on how to read and understand the UCC.

## § 1-108. Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.


Primary tabs







This article modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7001 et seq., except that nothing in this article modifies, limits, or supersedes Section 7001(c) of that Act or authorizes electronic delivery of any of the notices described in Section 7003(b) of that Act.

### commentary on ## § 1-108. Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.


This section establishes the relationship of this article to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, also known as the E-Sign Act. It declares that this article modifies, limits, and supersedes the E-Sign Act, with the exception of the provisions in Section 7001(c) of the Act, and it does not authorize electronic delivery of certain notices specified under Section 7003(b) of the Act. The E-Sign Act is an important piece of legislation that gives legal recognition to electronic signatures and records in commercial transactions, making them as legally binding as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures.

This section essentially suggests that while the E-Sign Act remains a crucial federal law, this article introduces modifications and limitations to it, presumably to accommodate more specific or localized needs. However, it also respects key provisions of the E-Sign Act, specifically Section 7001(c) - which generally prohibits requiring the use or acceptance of electronic records or signatures - and Section 7003(b) - which lists several types of notices or communications that are exempt from the Act's provisions.

In simpler terms, this section is a kind of "disclaimer" stating that while this article does relate to the E-Sign Act, it also amends and diverges from it in certain ways, without breaching some of the Act's crucial protections.

(a) Subject to subsection (f), a person has "notice" of a fact if the person: (1) has actual knowledge of it; (2) has received a notice or notification of it; or (3) from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists.(b) "Knowledge" means actual knowledge. "Knows" has a corresponding meaning.(c) "Discover", "learn", or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know.(d) A person "notifies" or "gives" a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.(e) Subject to subsection (f), a person "receives" a notice or notification when: (1) it comes to that person's attention; or (2) it is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of such communications.(f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.

§ 1-203. Lease Distinguished from Security Interest. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-202. Notice; Knowledge.


This section outlines the definitions and implications of notice and knowledge. 

Paragraph (a) stipulates that a person has "notice" of a fact if they have actual knowledge of it, have received a notice or notification of it or should reasonably know about it based on available information.

Paragraph (b) defines "knowledge" as actual knowledge and states that "knows" carries the same meaning.

Paragraph (c) clarifies that words like "discover" or "learn" pertain to actual knowledge, not reasonable suspicion or inference.

Paragraph (d) explains the process of notification, which involves reasonable steps to inform another person, regardless of whether the person becomes aware of the information.

Paragraph (e) deals with the receipt of notice or notification, stating that a person "receives" a notice when it comes to their attention or is properly delivered in a reasonable manner.

Paragraph (f) outlines when notice, knowledge, or notification is considered effective for an organization. This is when it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction, or when it would have been if the organization had exercised due diligence.

In summary, this section emphasizes actual knowledge as the basis for legal "knowledge" and "notice," and defines the procedures for giving and receiving notifications. There is an emphasis on reasonability and due diligence in communication, especially within organizational contexts, as key factors in considering whether notice or knowledge has effectively been given or received.

## § 1-203. Lease Distinguished from Security Interest.


Primary tabs







(a) Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.(b) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and: (1) the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods; (2) the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods; (3) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement; or (4) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.(c) A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because: (1) the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into; (2) the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods; (3) the lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs; (4) the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods; (5) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed; or (6) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.(d) Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if: (1) when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or (2) when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.(e) The "remaining economic life of the goods" and "reasonably predictable" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.

§ 1-204. Value. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-203. Lease Distinguished from Security Interest.


"Lease Distinguished from Security Interest" essentially deals with differentiating between leases and security interests. It suggests that the given facts of a lease transaction can determine whether it's actually a lease or a security interest. 

The provision implies that a lease may in fact be a security interest if the lessee has no option to terminate the lease obligation and the lease term covers the entire economic life of the leased goods. It might also be considered a security interest if the lessee has to become the owner of the goods, or has the option to do so for no or nominal additional cost.

On the other hand, if the lessee is obligated to pay an amount that matches or exceeds the goods' fair market value, assumes risk of loss, pays for fees or maintenance, or has the option to renew the lease or own the goods at a fair price, this does not inherently create a security interest. 

Further, nominal additional cost is defined as being less than the lessee's predictable cost of adhering to the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. 

Finally, terms like "remaining economic life of the goods" and "reasonably predictable" fair market values or costs must be determined based on the circumstances at the time of the lease transaction.

This section has implications for both lessees and lessors, providing clarity over the nature of lease agreements and helping to avoid potential legal disputes over ownership or financial obligations. It also ensures that parties involved in lease transactions understand their rights and responsibilities. 

In terms of analogy, this can be likened to the difference between renting a house (lease) and buying a house through a mortgage (security interest). The different rights and obligations towards the house in these two situations reflect the differing legal and financial implications of leases and security interests. 

This provision is a staple in the world of finance and property law, commonly referred to in disputes over commercial leasing agreements or financial transactions involving leased goods.

Except as otherwise provided in Articles 3, 4, [and] 5, [and 6], a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them: (1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit, whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection; (2) as security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim; (3) by accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or (4) in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.

### commentary on ## § 1-204. Value.


This section defines what constitutes as "giving value" for rights. In simpler terms, it tells us when a person can be considered to have given something of worth in exchange for rights. The law recognizes four specific scenarios under which a person can give value for rights: 

1) If they give a binding promise to extend credit or if they immediately extend credit, irrespective of whether it is drawn upon or if a provision is made for a charge-back (a demand by a credit-card provider for a retailer to make good the loss on a fraudulent or disputed transaction) in case collection becomes difficult. 

2) If they give value as a form of security, or to completely or partially satisfy a pre-existing claim. 

3) If they accept a delivery under a pre-existing purchase contract. 

4) If they give anything that can be considered sufficient to support a simple contract.

This section, however, does not apply to Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6.

## § 1-205. Reasonable time; Seasonableness.


Primary tabs







(a) Whether a time for taking an action required by the Uniform Commercial Code is reasonable depends on the nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action.(b) An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no time is agreed, at or within a reasonable time.

### commentary on ## § 1-205. Reasonable time; Seasonableness.


This section stipulates that the determination of what can be considered a reasonable time frame for any action required by the Uniform Commercial Code is based on the nature, purpose, and circumstances surrounding said action. Further, the clause clarifies that an action is deemed seasonable if it is undertaken at or within the time initially agreed upon or, in the absence of an agreement, at or within a reasonable time frame.

In simpler terms, this clause is saying: "What counts as 'reasonable' time to get something done depends on what you're trying to do, why, and what's going on around it. Also, if you do something 'seasonably', it means you did it within the time frame you agreed upon, or, if you didn't agree on a time, within what would be a 'reasonable' time."

Commonly referred to in situations where a party fails to fulfill their contractual obligations within the agreed-upon or reasonable time, this clause provides a legal basis for determining whether such a delay or inaction is in violation of the Uniform Commercial Code. 

For instance, if a supplier agreed to deliver goods within a week but fails to do so, this section could be referenced to determine whether the delay is reasonable based on the circumstances. Similarly, if no delivery time was agreed upon but the goods are delivered several months later, this clause could be used to argue that the delivery was not made within a reasonable time.

## § 1-206. Presumptions.


Primary tabs







Whenever the Uniform Commercial Code creates a "presumption" with respect to a fact, or provides that a fact is "presumed," the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact unless and until evidence is introduced that supports a finding of its nonexistence.

PART 3. TERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL RULES ›







### commentary on ## § 1-206. Presumptions.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code is about presumptions. Essentially, it states that if the law establishes a presumption about a specific fact, the person or group responsible for making a judgment about that fact (e.g., a judge or jury) must assume the fact to be true. This assumption stands unless evidence is presented that suggests the fact may not be true.

For example, let's say there's a presumption in law that a person is considered to have received a letter 3 days after it was sent. If a legal dispute arises about whether the person received the letter, the judge or jury would have to assume that the person did receive the letter 3 days after it was sent, unless evidence is presented that suggests otherwise (e.g., the person was out of town at the time).

This legal tool helps streamline the legal decision-making process by establishing certain facts as given, unless there's reason to believe otherwise. It cuts down on the amount of evidence that needs to be presented and examined in each case, making the legal process more efficient.

a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties.(b) In the absence of an agreement effective under subsection (a), and except as provided in subsection (c), [the Uniform Commercial Code] applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state.(c) If one of the following provisions of [the Uniform Commercial Code] specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law so specified:(1) Section 2-402;(2) Sections 2A-105 and 2A-106;(3) Section 4-102;(4) Section 4A-507;(5) Section 5-116;[(6) Section 6-103;(7) Section 8-110;(8) Sections 9-301 through 9-307.

§ 1-302. Variation by Agreement. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-301. Territorial Applicability; Parties' Power to Choose Applicable Law.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) outlines the conditions under which the laws of a particular state or nation may be applied to a transaction. Essentially, it allows parties involved in a transaction to agree on which state's laws will govern their transaction, provided the transaction reasonably relates to that state and another state or nation. 

However, in the absence of such an agreement, the UCC will apply to transactions that are appropriately related to the state. Certain sections of the UCC could override the parties' agreement, specifying the applicable law. In that case, a party's conflicting agreement will only be effective to the extent permitted by the law specified in the UCC.

In plain terms, this means that if you're conducting a business deal, you and the other party can decide which state's laws will apply if the transaction involves more than one state. But if you don't make an agreement, the UCC will dictate the applicable law. Additionally, some parts of the UCC have specific rules about which laws apply, and these rules can override the parties' agreement.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) or elsewhere in [the Uniform Commercial Code], the effect of provisions of [the Uniform Commercial Code] may be varied by agreement.(b) The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care prescribed by [the Uniform Commercial Code] may not be disclaimed by agreement. The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable. Whenever [the Uniform Commercial Code] requires an action to be taken within a reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.(c) The presence in certain provisions of [the Uniform Commercial Code] of the phrase "unless otherwise agreed", or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement under this section.

§ 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-302. Variation by Agreement.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) clarifies how the UCC can be modified by mutual agreement between parties involved in a commercial contract. 

In summary:

(a) Section 1-302(a) allows parties to a contract to alter the effects of the UCC provisions, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the UCC or in subsection (b).

(b) Section 1-302(b) explains that certain obligations, such as those of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care, cannot be disclaimed or waived by agreement. However, the parties can determine their own standards for these obligations, as long as they are not unreasonably unfair or one-sided. Also, if the UCC requires an action to be taken within a "reasonable time," the parties can agree on a specific time frame, as long as it's not absurdly long or short.

(c) Section 1-302(c) emphasizes that the appearance of phrases like "unless otherwise agreed" in some parts of the UCC does not mean that other sections can't also be varied by agreement, as stated in this section. 

In other words, while the UCC sets out standard rules for commercial transactions, parties have considerable flexibility to modify these rules to suit their particular needs or desires, within certain limits to ensure fairness and integrity in business dealings.

## § 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade.


Primary tabs







(a) A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if: (1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and (2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.(b) A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.(c) A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable: (1) express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade; (2) course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and (3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.(f) Subject to Section 2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.

§ 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade.


This section addresses key legal concepts such as "course of performance," "course of dealing," and "usage of trade." These are all measures that help establish the nature and terms of a business relationship or agreement.

A "course of performance" refers to how parties have acted within a specific transaction. It requires repetitive performance and acceptance by the other party. 

"Course of dealing" covers behavior in previous transactions, which can help interpret the understanding of the parties in a current transaction.

A "usage of trade" is a norm or practice within an industry, trade, or region that may affect the interpretation of a transaction. If such a usage is documented, such as in a trade code, it can be considered legally.

These concepts can be used to interpret the parties' agreement, give meaning to specific terms, and even supplement or qualify the terms. 

If there are any inconsistencies between the express terms of an agreement and these measures, the express terms typically prevail, followed by a course of performance, then course of dealing, and finally usage of trade. 

Finally, this section also allows for the possibility of waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance. It also stipulates that evidence of a relevant usage of trade is not admissible unless the other party has been given sufficient notice to prevent unfair surprises.

## § 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith.


Primary tabs







Every contract or duty within the Uniform Commercial Code imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.

up
§ 1-305. Remedies to be Liberally Administered. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) states that all parties involved in a contract or duty must act in good faith while performing their obligations or enforcing the agreement. This means that they must act honestly, with sincerity and without any intent to defraud, deceive or undermine the other party. 

An analogy for this section might be two friends promising to help each other with a mutual task. They both must perform their respective parts honestly and sincerely, without trying to trick or cheat the other. If one friend tries to get the other to do all the work without contributing their fair share, they are not upholding the obligation of good faith.

A significant timeline event related to this concept could be a case where a breach of the obligation of good faith led to a legal dispute. For example, in Market Street Associates Ltd. Partnership v. Frey, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that good faith in contract law includes the duty not to destroy the other party's reasonable expectations regarding the benefits of the contract.

A common comparable in other legal frameworks might be the concept of "bona fides" in Roman law, which also refers to a requirement of honesty and sincerity in legal agreements.

## § 1-305. Remedies to be Liberally Administered.


Primary tabs







(a) The remedies provided by [the Uniform Commercial Code] must be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in [the Uniform Commercial Code] or by other rule of law.(b) Any right or obligation declared by [the Uniform Commercial Code] is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.




‹ § 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith.
up
§ 1-306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach. ›







### commentary on ## § 1-305. Remedies to be Liberally Administered.


This statute basically states that the remedies for breach of contract under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) should be applied in a generous manner with a goal of putting the injured party in the position they would have been in had the contract been fully performed. However, it places restrictions on consequential, special, and punitive damages, allowing them only as specifically provided for in the UCC or other applicable law. Additionally, it affirms that any rights or obligations declared by the UCC can be enforced by legal action, unless otherwise specified.

This is akin to a doctor attempting to restore a patient to health after an injury - the goal being to bring them back to their pre-injury state as much as possible. However, like how a doctor cannot cause additional harm (consequential, special, or penal damages) other than in specific, justified circumstances, the UCC also puts constraints on these types of damages. 

The second part of the section is like saying that any promises made under the UCC (rights or obligations) can be enforced in court, unless the UCC itself indicates otherwise. This is similar to a parent telling a child they can ask for their toy back if their sibling took it, unless the parent has specifically said that the sibling was allowed to borrow it.

## § 1-306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach.

A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record.

up
§ 1-307. Prima Facie Evidence by Third-Party Documents.  ›







### commentary on ## § 1-306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach.


This section implies that if a party feels they have been wronged or suffered a breach of some kind, they can choose to waive or give up their claim or right to compensation. This must be done in writing and authenticated. This decision can be made without any form of compensation or payment.

In simpler terms, if you believe someone has broken a promise or agreement with you, you have the right to say "I'll let it slide this time" and officially document that decision. This waiver can be made for all or just part of the claim, and you don't have to be paid or get anything in return for this choice.

In a historical context, this has been used in legal cases where a party decides to forgive a breach of contract for a variety of reasons - maybe they feel it was a one-time mistake or the relationship is more important than the breach. This section makes sure that their decision is legally binding.

A well-known legal counterpart to this might be the concept of "release of liability", where a party agrees to not hold another party responsible for potential harm or damage.

But remember, once you've waived your right to a claim, it's usually final - so it's a decision that shouldn't be made lightly or without legal advice.

## § 1-307. Prima Facie Evidence by Third-Party Documents. 


Primary tabs







A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of insurance, official weigher's or inspector's certificate, consular invoice, or any other document authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.




‹ § 1-306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach.
up
§ 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights.  ›







### commentary on ## § 1-307. Prima Facie Evidence by Third-Party Documents. 


This section essentially states that any document that is presented in proper form and claims to be an official document (like a bill of lading, official weigher's certificate, insurance policy or certificate, consular invoice, etc.) that is required or permitted by the contract to be generated by a third party, is automatically considered as authentic and genuine. This extends not just to the document itself but also to the facts that the third party has stated in the document. 

For instance, if you have a contract that requires the other party to provide an official weigher's certificate, and they provide a document that seems to be in the proper form and claims to be the official weigher's certificate, this law states that you should assume that it's a genuine certificate and that the weights listed on it are correct, unless proven otherwise.

In simpler terms, this law works on the principle of "innocent until proven guilty". It assumes that the document and the facts within it are truthful and accurate, until there is evidence to show otherwise.

In terms of timeline events or counterparts, this law is typically applied in cases where the authenticity of a document or the facts within it are questioned. It places the burden of proof on the party questioning the document, rather than the party providing it.

## § 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights. 


Primary tabs







(a) A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved. Such words as "without prejudice," "under protest," or the like are sufficient.(b) Subsection (a) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.

up
§ 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will.  ›







### commentary on ## § 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights. 


This section essentially means that if a party agrees to perform an action but explicitly reserves their rights while doing so, they don't lose those rights. Common phrases used to indicate this reservation of rights include "without prejudice," "under protest," and similar. However, this doesn't apply to an accord and satisfaction, which is a legal contract where one party agrees to pay a certain amount and the other party agrees to accept it as full settlement of a dispute.

For example, let's say a contractor agrees to do additional work on a project "under protest." This means they are doing the work but reserve the right to seek further compensation or take other legal action.

This section is important in contract law as it allows parties to comply with contractual obligations without surrendering their rights.

## § 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will. 


Primary tabs







A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when the party "deems itself insecure," or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.




‹ § 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights. 
up
§ 1-310. Subordinated Obligations.  ›







### commentary on ## § 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will. 


In simpler terms, this section discusses a provision in contracts that allows one party to fast-forward the terms of the agreement for immediate payment or completion. This can also include the requirement for additional collateral. However, this can only be done if the party genuinely believes that the other party may not fulfill their part of the deal. If this power is exercised, the other party can challenge it, but they must prove that the first party acted in bad faith.

An example of this could be a lender who has loaned money to a borrower. If the lender has reason to believe that the borrower may not be able to repay the loan, they may invoke the acceleration clause to demand immediate full repayment. However, if the borrower disputes this, they would need to prove that the lender had no legitimate reason to believe they would default, and therefore acted in bad faith.

There are no significant timeline events or commonly referred counterparts connected to this section.

## § 1-310. Subordinated Obligations. 


Primary tabs







An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated. Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.




‹ § 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will. 
up
U.C.C. - ARTICLE 2 - SALES (2002) ›







### commentary on ## § 1-310. Subordinated Obligations. 


This law essentially allows a debt or obligation to be ranked lower in priority compared to another debt or obligation from the same debtor. It means that the repayment of this "subordinated" debt will take place only after the "senior" debts have been paid off. This subordination can be agreed upon by the debtor, the creditor, or another creditor of the debtor. However, this subordination does not provide any form of security interest against the debtor or the subordinated creditor. 

Think of it as being in a queue for a buffet. The senior debts are at the front of the queue and get to eat first. The subordinated debts are further back and only get to eat after the senior debts have had their fill. However, being further back in the queue doesn't mean they get any special privileges or protections.

In the context of the UCC - Article 2 - Sales, this could relate to the sale of goods on credit or the financing of sales. If a business sells goods on credit, the debt that arises from the sale could be subordinated to other debts of the business. Similarly, if a business borrows money to finance sales, the debt from the loan could be subordinated to other debts.

§ 1-103. Construction of Uniform Commercial Code to Promote its Purposes and Policies: Applicability of Supplemental Principles of Law.
This is essentially the blueprint for the UCC. It details how it should be interpreted and applied, and brings in other legal principles to ensure it's not existing in a vacuum.

§ 1-104. Construction Against Implied Repeal.
This provision acts as a shield, protecting the UCC from being undermined or invalidated by other laws unless it's explicitly intended.

This is the "break glass in case of emergency" clause. If one part of the UCC is found to be invalid, it doesn't bring down the whole structure - the rest of the code can still stand.

This section is the grammar rulebook for the UCC. It clarifies that the code's language isn't limited by number or gender.

This part is the "headlines" of the UCC. It points out that the titles given to each section are just for convenience and don't affect the substance of the laws.
