§ 1-103. Construction of Uniform Commercial Code to Promote its Purposes and Policies: Applicability of Supplemental Principles of Law. ›





This section explains that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) only applies to a transaction if it is not covered by another article of the UCC. In other words, this section sets the boundaries for when the UCC can be used as a legal framework for a transaction. It is an important starting point for understanding how the UCC operates in practice.

§ 1-104. Construction Against Implied Repeal. ›





This section explains that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) should be interpreted in a way that supports its goals of simplifying, clarifying, and modernizing commercial law, allowing for flexible commercial practices, and creating uniformity across jurisdictions. It also states that the principles of law and equity, such as those related to contracts, fraud, and bankruptcy, should supplement the UCC unless they are specifically overridden by its provisions.

The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under Section 2-401 is limited in effect to a reservation of a "security interest." Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a "security interest" is determined pursuant to Section 1-203.(36) "Send" in connection with a writing, record, or notice means: (A) to deposit in the mail or deliver for transmission by any other usual means of communication with postage or cost of transmission provided for and properly addressed and, in the case of an instrument, to an address specified thereon or otherwise agreed, or if there be none to any address reasonable under the circumstances; or (B) in any other way to cause to be received any record or notice within the time it would have arrived if properly sent.(37) "Signed" includes using any symbol executed or adopted with present intention to adopt or accept a writing.(38) "State" means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, or any territory or insular possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.(39) "Surety" includes a guarantor or other secondary obligor.(40) "Term" means a portion of an agreement that relates to a particular matter.(41) "Unauthorized signature" means a signature made without actual, implied, or apparent authority.

This section of the Uniform Commercial Code provides definitions for various terms used throughout the code, including "action", "agreement", "buyer in ordinary course of business", "document of title", "good faith", "insolvency proceeding", "party", "security interest", and more. The definitions are intended to provide clarity and consistency in interpretation of the code.

(a) Subject to subsection (f), a person has "notice" of a fact if the person: (1) has actual knowledge of it; (2) has received a notice or notification of it; or (3) from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists.(b) "Knowledge" means actual knowledge. "Knows" has a corresponding meaning.(c) "Discover", "learn", or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know.(d) A person "notifies" or "gives" a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.(e) Subject to subsection (f), a person "receives" a notice or notification when: (1) it comes to that person's attention; or (2) it is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of such communications.(f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.




‹ § 1-201. General Definitions.
up
§ 1-203. Lease Distinguished from Security Interest. ›





This section lays out the different ways that a person can have "notice" of a fact in a legal context, including actual knowledge, receiving a notice, or having reason to know. "Knowledge" specifically means actual knowledge. The section also defines how someone can "notify" or "give" notice to another person, and when a notice is considered "received" by someone. 

When it comes to organizations, notice or knowledge is effective if it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction, or if the organization exercises due diligence in communicating significant information. Due diligence means maintaining reasonable routines for communication and reasonable compliance with those routines. 

Overall, this section is clarifying the concept of notice and how it applies in legal situations.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.(b) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and: (1) the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods; (2) the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods; (3) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement; or (4) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.(c) A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because: (1) the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into; (2) the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods; (3) the lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs; (4) the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods; (5) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed; or (6) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.(d) Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if: (1) when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or (2) when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.(e) The "remaining economic life of the goods" and "reasonably predictable" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.




‹ § 1-202. Notice; Knowledge.
up
§ 1-204. Value. ›





This section explains how to determine whether a transaction is a lease or a security interest, based on the specific details of the agreement. If the lessee is obligated to pay for the use of the goods for the entire term of the lease and has limited options to terminate or renew the lease, the transaction may be considered a security interest. However, certain factors, such as the value of the consideration and the options available to the lessee, may not necessarily make the transaction a security interest. The terms of the agreement must be analyzed to determine the economic life of the goods and the fair market value or rent. Additional consideration may be considered nominal if it is less than the lessee's predicted cost of performing under the lease agreement.

This section explains that parties involved in a transaction that relates to multiple states or nations can agree to have the law of one of those places govern their rights and responsibilities. If they don't make such an agreement, the Uniform Commercial Code applies to the transaction as long as it is relevant to the state in question. However, if a specific provision of the Uniform Commercial Code specifies which law should apply, that provision overrides any agreement between the parties.

The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable. Whenever [the Uniform Commercial Code] requires an action to be taken within a reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.(c) The presence in certain provisions of [the Uniform Commercial Code] of the phrase "unless otherwise agreed", or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement under this section.

§ 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade. ›





This section of the Uniform Commercial Code allows for the variation of its provisions through agreement, except for certain obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care. Parties may establish their own standards for performance as long as they are not extremely unreasonable, and can agree on reasonable time frames for actions. The presence of certain phrases in the Code does not limit the ability to vary provisions through agreement.
----
Page Title: § 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if: (1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and (2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.(b) A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.(c) A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable: (1) express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade; (2) course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and (3) course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.(f) Subject to Section 2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.




‹ § 1-302. Variation by Agreement.
up
§ 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith. ›





Section 1-303 defines three terms that can help interpret the meaning of a contract: course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade. A course of performance is a repeated sequence of conduct between the parties that is accepted or acquiesced in without objection. A course of dealing is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions that establishes a common understanding. A usage of trade is a practice or method of dealing that is regularly observed in a specific trade or place.

These three factors can be used to supplement or qualify the terms of an agreement and may give particular meaning to specific terms. However, if the express terms of the agreement and these factors are inconsistent, the express terms prevail, followed by course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade in that order.

A course of performance can also be used to show a waiver or modification of a term inconsistent with the course of performance, but notice must be given to the other party.

Overall, the section emphasizes the importance of good faith and fair dealing in interpreting the meaning of a contract.

§ 1-305. Remedies to be Liberally Administered. ›





This section of the Uniform Commercial Code states that every contract or duty comes with the expectation of good faith in both its execution and enforcement. Essentially, all parties involved are expected to act honestly and fairly towards each other in carrying out their obligations. This obligation is a fundamental principle of the UCC and applies to all types of business transactions. It is intended to promote fairness and prevent any kind of dishonest or fraudulent behavior that could harm one or more parties involved in the contract. Overall, the obligation of good faith is a key aspect of maintaining trust and integrity within commercial transactions.

Essentially, this means that if someone chooses to give up their right to pursue a claim or remedy for a breach, they can do so without any compensation, as long as it is documented properly. It's kind of like settling a dispute out of court - both parties agree to let go of their claims, even if one party may have a stronger case. However, it's important to note that this section only applies after a breach has occurred - you can't waive or renounce a claim before anything has happened.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of insurance, official weigher's or inspector's certificate, consular invoice, or any other document authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.

§ 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights.  ›





This section establishes that certain documents authorized or required by a third party, such as bills of lading or insurance policies, are considered to be valid evidence of their own authenticity and the facts stated within them. Essentially, if a document appears to be legitimate and comes from a reputable source, it can be presumed to be true unless proven otherwise. This can be helpful in legal disputes where parties may need to provide evidence of certain transactions or arrangements.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved. Such words as "without prejudice," "under protest," or the like are sufficient.(b) Subsection (a) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.

§ 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will.  ›





This section discusses how a party can perform or accept performance under reservation of rights, meaning they can do so without giving up their rights. This can be done by using language such as "without prejudice" or "under protest." However, this does not apply to situations where an accord and satisfaction is reached. In other words, a party cannot use this provision to retract an agreement that has already been fully settled.

Page Title: § 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will. 
Tab Content: Primary tabs







A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when the party "deems itself insecure," or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.




‹ § 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights. 
up
§ 1-310. Subordinated Obligations.  ›





This section explains that if a contract includes a provision allowing one party to demand payment or performance at any time they feel insecure about the other party's ability to pay, that power can only be used if the demanding party has a good faith belief that payment or performance is indeed at risk. The burden of proving lack of good faith falls on the party being demanded from. Essentially, this provision prevents one party from arbitrarily calling for payment or additional collateral without a legitimate reason.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated. Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.

‹ § 1-108. Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.
up
§ 1-201. General Definitions. ›





This section provides general definitions that apply throughout the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Some of the key definitions include:

- "Goods" refers to tangible, movable items.
- "Merchant" refers to a person who deals in goods of the kind being sold or who has knowledge or skill specific to the goods involved in the transaction.
- "Contract" refers to an agreement between two parties that creates an obligation to perform certain actions.
- "Sale" refers to the transfer of ownership of goods in exchange for money or other consideration.
- "Buyer" refers to a person who acquires ownership in goods under a sale.
- "Seller" refers to a person who transfers ownership in goods under a sale.

Other definitions include "security interest," "document of title," and "good faith."

Overall, these definitions are meant to provide clarity and consistency in how terms are used throughout the UCC.

§ 1-202. Notice; Knowledge.
This section deals with the concept of notice and knowledge in UCC transactions. Essentially, if a person has notice of a fact, or has knowledge of a fact, that fact is considered to be known to them for purposes of the transaction. This can be important in situations where a party may be trying to avoid liability by claiming they didn't know about a particular issue.

§ 1-203. Lease Distinguished from Security Interest.
This section explains the difference between a lease and a security interest. A lease is a transaction in which the lessor (owner) allows the lessee (renter) to use goods for a period of time in exchange for payments. A security interest, on the other hand, is a transaction in which a creditor takes an interest in a debtor's property as collateral for a debt. It's important to distinguish between the two because they have different legal implications and obligations.

§ 1-204. Value.
This section defines the concept of "value" in UCC transactions. Generally, value refers to any consideration that is given in exchange for a good or service. For example, money, goods, services, or even a promise to pay later can all be considered value. A key concept in UCC transactions, value can be important in determining whether a transaction is enforceable or not.

§ 1-205. Reasonable time; Seasonableness.
This section deals with the concepts of "reasonable time" and "seasonableness" in UCC transactions. Essentially, these concepts are meant to ensure that parties act in a timely and appropriate manner during a transaction. For example, if a buyer fails to inspect goods in a reasonable amount of time after receiving them, they may be considered to have accepted the goods even if there are defects. Similarly, if a seller takes an unreasonably long time to ship goods, they may be considered to have breached their obligations.

§ 1-206. Presumptions.
This section explains the concept of presumptions in UCC transactions. Presumptions are assumptions that are made based on certain facts or circumstances. For example, if a buyer and seller are both merchants, there is a presumption that they both have knowledge of industry practices and standards. Presumptions can be important in determining the outcome of disputes or in establishing certain facts in a transaction.

up
§ 1-301. Territorial Applicability; Parties' Power to Choose Applicable Law. ›





This section outlines the territorial applicability of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and allows parties to choose which law will govern their contract. Essentially, the UCC applies to transactions that involve parties from different states or countries, as long as the transaction has a substantial relationship to the U.S. But if the parties agree to a different law, that law will apply instead. Think of it like choosing which language to speak in a multilingual conversation.

§ 1-302. Variation by Agreement.
Parties are allowed to vary the terms of a contract by agreement, as long as it doesn't violate the UCC. This means that if two parties want to change a provision in their contract, they can do so as long as it doesn't go against the UCC's rules. Think of it like adding your own toppings to a pizza, as long as it doesn't break any health codes.

§ 1-303. Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade.
This section says that if there's a dispute over the terms of a contract, the parties can look to their past dealings (course of performance), their general business practices (course of dealing), and industry customs (usage of trade) to help interpret the contract. Think of it like referencing a dictionary to figure out the meaning of a word.

§ 1-304. Obligation of Good Faith.
Parties to a contract are required to act in good faith, meaning they can't act in a way that would violate the reasonable expectations of the other party. This means that if one party knows something that would affect the other party's decision to enter into a contract, they have to disclose it. Think of it like playing fair in a game of cards.

§ 1-305. Remedies to be Liberally Administered.
This section says that if there's a breach of contract, the party who was harmed is entitled to a remedy. The UCC provides a variety of remedies, such as damages, specific performance, or cancellation of the contract. Think of it like having a toolbox with different tools to fix a problem.

§ 1-306. Waiver or Renunciation of Claim or Right After Breach.
If one party breaches a contract, the other party can choose to waive their right to a remedy or renounce the contract altogether. However, this must be done in a timely manner and in a way that doesn't harm the breaching party's ability to cure the breach. Think of it like choosing to forgive someone for breaking a promise, but not doing so in a way that enables them to continue breaking promises.

§ 1-307. Prima Facie Evidence by Third-Party Documents.
This section allows for certain documents, such as invoices or bills of lading, to be used as evidence in a contract dispute. These documents are considered "prima facie" evidence, meaning they are presumed to be true unless proven otherwise. Think of it like a detective using a piece of evidence to build a case.

§ 1-308. Performance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights.
If a party performs under a contract but has reservations about some aspect of it, they can do so "under reservation of rights." This means that they are still entitled to seek a remedy if the other party breaches the contract. Think of it like crossing your fingers while making a promise, just in case you need to hold the other person accountable.

§ 1-309. Option to Accelerate at Will.
This section allows for one party to accelerate the payment or performance of a contract at their discretion. However, this can only be done if the contract explicitly allows for it or if the other party agrees. Think of it like deciding to pay off a loan early, but only if the terms of the loan allow for it.

§ 1-310. Subordinated Obligations.
If a contract involves multiple obligations, one obligation can be subordinated to another. This means that the subordinated obligation won't be enforceable until the other obligation is fulfilled. Think of it like putting a hold on a check until a previous payment has cleared.
