Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) Except as provided in
	subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable
	instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to
	pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described
	in the promise or order, if it:
(1) is payable to bearer or to order at
	the time it is issued or first comes into possession of
	a holder;
(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and
(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction
	by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the
	payment of money, but the promise or order may
	contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral
	to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment
	or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of
	any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.
(b) "Instrument" means
	a negotiable instrument.
(c) An order that
	meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise
	falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable
	instrument and a check.
(d) A promise or order other
	than a check is not an instrument if,
	at the time it is issued or first comes into possession
	of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the
	effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed
	by this Article.
(e) An instrument is
	a "note" if it
	is a promise and is a "draft" if
	it is an order. If an instrument falls within the
	definition of both "note" and "draft," a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.
(f) "Check" means
	(i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on
	demand and drawn on a bank or (ii) a cashier's check or teller's
	check. An instrument may be a check even
	though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order."
(g) "Cashier's
		check" means a draft with respect to which
		the drawer and drawee are the same
		bank or branches of the same bank.
(h) "Teller's
		check" means a draft drawn by a bank (i) on
		another bank, or (ii) payable at or through a bank.
(i) "Traveler's
		check" means an instrument that (i) is
		payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (iii)
		is designated by the term "traveler's check" or by a substantially
		similar term, and (iv) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature
		by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.
(j) "Certificate
		of deposit" means an instrument containing
		an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank
		and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A
		certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.

§ 3-105. ISSUE	OF INSTRUMENT. ›





This section defines a negotiable instrument as an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, which is payable to order or bearer and does not contain any additional instructions or undertakings. A check is also considered a negotiable instrument if it meets certain requirements. An instrument may be a note or a draft, and a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either. The section also defines various types of checks, including cashier's checks and traveler's checks, as well as certificates of deposit.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) "Issue" means
	the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer,
	whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument
	to any person.
(b) An unissued instrument,
	or an unissued incomplete instrument that
	is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer,
	but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued
	or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure
	of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.
(c) "Issuer" applies
	to issued and unissued instruments and
	means a maker or drawer of an instrument.




‹ § 3-104. NEGOTIABLE	INSTRUMENT.
up
§ 3-106. UNCONDITIONAL	PROMISE OR ORDER. ›





This section defines "issue" as the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer to give rights on the instrument to any person, whether holder or nonholder. An unissued or incomplete instrument that is completed is still binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance can be used as a defense. The term "issuer" applies to both issued and unissued instruments and refers to the maker or drawer.
----
Page Title: § 3-106. UNCONDITIONAL	PROMISE OR ORDER.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) Except as provided in
	this section, for the purposes of Section 3-104(a), a promise or order is
	unconditional unless it states (i) an express condition to payment, (ii) that
	the promise or order is subject to or governed by another record, or (iii) that
	rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another
	record. A reference to another record does not of itself make the promise
	or order conditional.
(b) A promise or order is
	not made conditional (i) by a reference to another record for a statement of
	rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (ii) because
	payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.
(c) If a promise or order requires,
	as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature
	appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or
	order conditional for the purposes of Section 3-104(a). If
	the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails
	to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the
	obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent
	a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.
(d) If a promise or order at
	the time it is issued or first comes into possession of
	a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative
	law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to
	claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against
	the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for
	the purposes of Section 3-104(a); but if the promise
	or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder
	in due course of the instrument.




‹ § 3-105. ISSUE	OF INSTRUMENT.
up
§ 3-107. INSTRUMENT	PAYABLE IN FOREIGN MONEY. ›





This section explains what makes a promise or order unconditional for the purposes of Section 3-104(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code. It states that a promise or order is considered unconditional unless it has an express condition to payment, is subject to or governed by another record, or states that rights or obligations are stated in another record. However, a reference to another record does not make the promise or order conditional. 

The section also clarifies that a promise or order is not made conditional by a reference to another record for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source. 

If a promise or order requires a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional. However, if the person fails to countersign the instrument, it is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but does not prevent a transferee from becoming a holder of the instrument. 

Finally, if a promise or order contains a statement that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, it does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of Section 3-104(a). However, if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.

Unless the instrument otherwise
	provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in foreign money may
	be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated
	by using the current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the
	purchase of dollars on the day on which the instrument is paid.

§ 3-108. PAYABLE	ON DEMAND OR AT DEFINITE TIME. ›





This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines that if an instrument states a payment amount in foreign currency, it can be paid in that currency or in the equivalent amount in US dollars based on the current exchange rate.
----
Page Title: § 3-108. PAYABLE	ON DEMAND OR AT DEFINITE TIME.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) A promise or order is "payable
		on demand" if it (i) states that it is payable on demand or at
		sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the holder,
		or (ii) does not state any time of payment.
(b) A promise or order is "payable
		at a definite time" if it is payable on elapse of a definite period
		of time after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date
		or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the promise
		or order is issued, subject to rights of (i) prepayment,
		(ii) acceleration, (iii) extension at the option of the holder, or (iv) extension
		to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or
		automatically upon or after a specified act or event.
(c) If an instrument,
	payable at a fixed date, is also payable upon demand made before the fixed date,
	the instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for
	payment is not made before that date, becomes payable at a definite time on
	the fixed date.




‹ § 3-107. INSTRUMENT	PAYABLE IN FOREIGN MONEY.
up
§ 3-109. PAYABLE	TO BEARER OR TO ORDER. ›





Section 3-108 of the Uniform Commercial Code defines when a promise or order is considered payable on demand or at a definite time. An instrument is considered payable on demand if it explicitly states so or if it does not specify a time of payment. An instrument is considered payable at a definite time if it is payable after a set period of time or on a fixed date, subject to certain conditions like prepayment, acceleration, or extension. If an instrument is payable at a fixed date but can also be paid on demand before that date, it is considered payable on demand until the fixed date.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) A promise or order is
	payable to bearer if it:
(1) states that it is payable to bearer or to the order of
	bearer or otherwise indicates that the person in possession of the promise or
	order is entitled to payment;
(2) does not state a payee; or
(3) states that it is payable to or to the order of
	cash or otherwise indicates that it is not payable to an identified person.
(b) A promise or order that
	is not payable to bearer is payable to order if it is payable (i) to the order
	of an identified person or (ii) to an identified person or order. A promise
	or order that is payable to order is payable to the identified person.
(c) An instrument payable
	to bearer may become payable to an identified person if it is specially indorsed
	pursuant to Section 3-205(a). An instrument payable
	to an identified person may become payable to bearer if it is indorsed in blank
	pursuant to Section 3-205(b).

§ 3-110. IDENTIFICATION	OF PERSON TO WHOM INSTRUMENT IS PAYABLE. ›





This section explains the rules for determining whether a promise or order is payable to bearer or to order. If an instrument is payable to bearer, it means that whoever is currently in possession of the instrument is entitled to payment. If an instrument is payable to order, it means that payment can only be made to an identified person or to someone who has been authorized by that person. This section also explains how an instrument can be transferred from bearer to an identified person or vice versa through proper endorsement.
----
Page Title: § 3-110. IDENTIFICATION	OF PERSON TO WHOM INSTRUMENT IS PAYABLE.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) The person to whom an instrument is
	initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not
	authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of
	the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the
	signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other
	identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one
	person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the
	signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to
	any person intended by one or more of the signers.
(b) If the signature of the issuer of
	an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the
	payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied
	the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.
(c) A person to whom an instrument is
	payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number,
	office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of
	an instrument, the following rules apply:
(1) If an instrument is
	payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument
	is payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument
	is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the
	instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the
	owner of the account identified by number.
(2) If an instrument is
	payable to:
(i) a trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee
	or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is
	payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether
	or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;
(ii) a person described as agent or similar representative
	of a named or identified person, the instrument is
	payable to the represented person, the representative,
	or a successor of the representative;
(iii) a fund or organization that is not a legal entity,
	the instrument is payable to a representative of the
	members of the fund or organization; or
(iv) an office or to a person described as holding an
	office, the instrument is payable to the named person,
	the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.
(d) If an instrument is
	payable to two or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and
	may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession
	of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons
	not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged,
	or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two or more
	persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively,
	the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.




‹ § 3-109. PAYABLE	TO BEARER OR TO ORDER.
up
§ 3-111. PLACE	OF PAYMENT. ›





This section explains how the person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined based on the intent of the signer, even if the identification is not the name of the intended person. If an instrument is signed by multiple people, it is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers. If the signature is made by automated means, the payee is determined by the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee. The payee may be identified by name, number, office, or account number. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons alternatively, any of them can negotiate, discharge, or enforce it, but if it is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, all of them must do so. If an instrument is ambiguous, it is payable to the persons alternatively.
----
Page Title: § 3-111. PLACE	OF PAYMENT.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







Except as otherwise provided for items in Article 4, an instrument is
	payable at the place of payment stated in the instrument. If no place
	of payment is stated, an instrument is payable at the address of the drawee or maker stated
	in the instrument. If no address is stated, the place of payment is the
	place of business of the drawee or maker. If a drawee or maker has more
	than one place of business, the place of payment is any place of business of
	the drawee or maker chosen by the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument. If the drawee or maker has no
	place of business, the place of payment is the residence of the drawee or maker.




‹ § 3-110. IDENTIFICATION	OF PERSON TO WHOM INSTRUMENT IS PAYABLE.
up
§ 3-112. INTEREST. ›





This section outlines where an instrument must be paid, based on the information stated within the instrument itself. If a place of payment is not explicitly stated, the default is the address or place of business of the drawee or maker. If the drawee or maker has multiple places of business, the person entitled to enforce the instrument can choose where it should be paid. If there is no place of business, payment must be made at the drawee or maker's residence. This section does not apply to items covered in Article 4.

(a) Unless otherwise provided
	in the instrument, (i) an instrument is not payable
	with interest, and (ii) interest on an interest-bearing instrument is payable
	from the date of the instrument.
(b) Interest may be stated
	in an instrument as a fixed or variable amount of
	money or it may be expressed as a fixed or variable rate or rates. The
	amount or rate of interest may be stated or described in the instrument in any
	manner and may require reference to information not contained in the instrument. If
	an instrument provides for interest, but the amount of interest payable cannot
	be ascertained from the description, interest is payable at the judgment rate
	in effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest
	first accrues.

§ 3-113. DATE	OF INSTRUMENT. ›





This section deals with the issue of interest in financial instruments. Unless specifically stated otherwise, instruments do not carry interest and interest-bearing instruments accrue interest from the date of issuance. Interest may be stated as a fixed or variable amount or rate and can be described in any manner, even requiring external information. If the amount of interest cannot be determined from the description, it will be payable at the judgment rate in effect at the place of payment and at the time interest first accrues.

(a) An instrument may
	be antedated or postdated. The date stated determines the time of payment
	if the instrument is payable at a fixed period after date. Except as provided
	in Section 4-401(c),
	an instrument payable on demand is not payable before the date of the instrument.
(b) If an instrument is
	undated, its date is the date of its issue or, in the case
	of an unissued instrument, the date it first comes into possession of a holder.

§ 3-114. CONTRADICTORY	TERMS OF INSTRUMENT. ›





§ 3-113 explains that an instrument can be antedated or postdated, with the stated date determining the time of payment if the instrument has a fixed payment period. An instrument payable on demand cannot be paid before its date, unless otherwise specified in Section 4-401(c). If an instrument is undated, its date is either the date of its issue or the date it first comes into possession of a holder.

If there are conflicting terms in a legal instrument, such as a contract or agreement, the hierarchy of authority for the terms is as follows: typewritten terms take precedence over printed terms, handwritten terms take precedence over both typewritten and printed terms, and words take precedence over numbers. This section helps to ensure clarity and consistency in legal documents and prevent disputes arising from conflicting terms.

(a) "Incomplete
		instrument" means a signed writing, whether or not issued by
		the signer, the contents of which show at the time of signing that it is incomplete
		but that the signer intended it to be completed by the addition of words or
		numbers.
(b) Subject to subsection
	(c), if an incomplete instrument is an instrument under
	Section 3-104, it may be enforced according to its terms
	if it is not completed, or according to its terms as augmented by completion. If
	an incomplete instrument is not an instrument under Section 3-104,
	but, after completion, the requirements of Section 3-104 are
	met, the instrument may be enforced according to its terms as augmented by completion.
(c) If words or numbers are
	added to an incomplete instrument without authority of the signer, there is
	an alteration of the incomplete instrument under Section 3-407.
(d) The burden of establishing
	that words or numbers were added to an incomplete instrument without authority
	of the signer is on the person asserting the lack of authority.

This section defines an incomplete instrument as a signed writing that is intended to be completed by adding words or numbers. If the incomplete instrument is considered an instrument under Section 3-104, it can be enforced according to its terms even if it is not completed, or after completion. However, if words or numbers are added without the signer's authority, it is considered an alteration under Section 3-407. The burden of proof for lack of authority lies with the person making the claim. Joint and several liability and contribution are addressed in Section 3-116.

	becomes its holder.
(b) Except for negotiation by
	a remitter, if an instrument is

If the instrument is payable to a specific person, the holder must also endorse it for it to be negotiated, but if it is payable to bearer, possession alone is enough. This section is part of the larger Part 2, which covers negotiation, transfer, and endorsement of financial instruments.

Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) An instrument is
	transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer
	for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce
	the instrument.
(b) Transfer of an instrument,
	whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests
	in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including
	any right as a holder in due course, but the
	transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly
	or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud
	or illegality affecting the instrument.
(c) Unless otherwise agreed,
	if an instrument is transferred for value and the
	transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by
	the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified
	indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of
	the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.
(d) If a transferor purports
	to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of
	the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under
	this Article and has only the rights of a partial assignee.

§ 3-204. INDORSEMENT. ›





This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines the rules for transferring a negotiable instrument, such as a promissory note or check. 

According to (a), an instrument is considered transferred when it is delivered to someone else for the purpose of giving them the right to enforce it. 

(b) explains that when an instrument is transferred, the recipient acquires any rights that the transferor had to enforce it. However, if the transferor acquired those rights through fraud or illegality, the recipient cannot become a holder in due course. 

In (c), it is stated that if an instrument is transferred for value but the transferor did not endorse it, the recipient has the right to demand endorsement, but the negotiation of the instrument will not occur until that endorsement is made. 

Finally, (d) states that if a transferor tries to transfer less than the entire instrument, the recipient does not gain any rights to it. 

Overall, these rules aim to ensure that the transfer of negotiable instruments is done in a way that protects the rights of all parties involved.

(a) "Indorsement" means
	a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer,
	or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words
	is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating
	the instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser's liability
	on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and
	its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms
	of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously
	indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For
	the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper
	affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.
(b) "Indorser" means
	a person who makes an indorsement.
(c) For the purpose of determining
	whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder,
	an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective
	as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.
(d) If an instrument is
	payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement

This section of the Uniform Commercial Code defines and explains the concept of indorsement, which is a signature made on an instrument for the purpose of negotiating, restricting payment, or incurring liability. It also defines an indorser as the person who makes an indorsement. 

Additionally, this section states that an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection. 

In summary, this section outlines the rules and regulations surrounding indorsement for negotiating and transferring instruments.

Page Title: § 3-205. SPECIAL	INDORSEMENT; BLANK INDORSEMENT; ANOMALOUS INDORSEMENT.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) If an indorsement is
	made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable
	to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies
	a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special
	indorsement." When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes
	payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement
	of that person. The principles stated in Section 3-110 apply
	to special indorsements.
(b) If an indorsement is
	made by the holder of an instrument and it is not
	a special indorsement, it is a "blank
	indorsement." When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes
	payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until
	specially indorsed.
(c) The holder may convert
	a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement
	by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words
	identifying the person to whom the instrument is made
	payable.
(d) "Anomalous
		indorsement" means an indorsement made
		by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An
		anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may
		be negotiated.




‹ § 3-204. INDORSEMENT.
up
§ 3-206. RESTRICTIVE	INDORSEMENT. ›





This section explains the different types of indorsements that can be made on an instrument. A "special indorsement" identifies a specific person to whom the instrument is payable and can only be negotiated by that person. A "blank indorsement" makes the instrument payable to bearer and can be transferred by possession alone. A "anomalous indorsement" is made by someone who is not the holder of the instrument and does not affect how the instrument can be negotiated. The holder of a blank indorsement can convert it to a special indorsement by writing in the name of the person to whom it is payable above the signature.

Page Title: § 3-206. RESTRICTIVE	INDORSEMENT.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) An indorsement limiting
	payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of
	the instrument is not effective to prevent further
	transfer or negotiation of the instrument.
(b) An indorsement stating
	a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect
	the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A
	person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard
	the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected
	by whether the condition has been fulfilled.
(c) If an instrument bears
	an indorsement (i) described in Section 4-201(b),
	or (ii) in blank or to a particular bank using the words "for deposit," "for
	collection," or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument
	collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular
	account, the following rules apply:
(1) A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when
	so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument
	is received by the indorser or applied consistently
	with the indorsement.
(2) A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or
	takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the
	amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or
	applied consistently with the indorsement.
(3) A payor bank that is also the depositary bank
	or that takes the instrument for immediate payment
	over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument
	unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or
	applied consistently with the indorsement.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3),
	a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the indorsement and
	is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are
	not received by the indorser or applied consistently
	with the indorsement.
(d) Except for an indorsement covered
	by subsection (c), if an instrument bears an indorsement
	using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the indorsee as agent,
	trustee, or other fiduciary for the benefit of the indorser or
	another person, the following rules apply:
(1) Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty
	as provided in Section 3-307, a person who purchases the instrument from
	the indorsee or takes the instrument from the indorsee for collection or payment
	may pay the proceeds of payment or the value given for the instrument to the
	indorsee without regard to whether the indorsee violates a fiduciary duty to
	the indorser.
(2) A subsequent transferee of the instrument or
	person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected
	by the restriction in the indorsement unless the
	transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt
	with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.
(e) The presence on an instrument of
	an indorsement to which this section applies does
	not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder
	in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under
	subsection (c) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty
	as stated in subsection (d).
(f) In an action to enforce
	the obligation of a party to pay the instrument,
	the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an indorsement to
	which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.




‹ § 3-205. SPECIAL	INDORSEMENT; BLANK INDORSEMENT; ANOMALOUS INDORSEMENT.

§ 3-207. REACQUISITION. ›





Section 3-206 outlines the rules regarding restrictive endorsements on negotiable instruments. It states that an endorsement limiting payment to a particular person or prohibiting further transfer of the instrument is not effective to prevent further negotiation. An endorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect their right to enforce the instrument. If an instrument bears an endorsement for deposit or collection, a person who purchases it converts the instrument unless the amount paid is consistent with the endorsement. A payor bank may disregard the endorsement unless it is also the depositary bank or takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter. An endorsement designating payment to an agent or fiduciary does not affect the right of a subsequent transferee or person who pays the instrument unless they have knowledge of a breach of fiduciary duty. The presence of a restrictive endorsement does not prevent a purchaser from becoming a holder in due course unless they are a converter or have notice of a breach of fiduciary duty. In an action to enforce payment, an obligor has a defense if payment would violate a restrictive endorsement and is not permitted by this section.

	causes the instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the reacquirer
	may negotiate the instrument. An indorser whose

This section covers the reacquisition of an instrument, which occurs when a former holder receives it again through negotiation or other means. The former holder can then cancel any indorsements made after they first became a holder. If this cancellation results in the instrument being payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, they can negotiate it. However, any indorser whose indorsement is canceled is discharged and this discharge applies to any subsequent holder.

(a) Subject to subsection
	(c) and Section 3-106(d), "holder
	in due course" means the holder of an instrument if:
(1) the instrument when issued or
	negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or
	is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity;
	and
(2) the holder took the instrument (i)
	for value, (ii) in good faith, (iii) without notice
	that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured
	default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as
	part of the same series, (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an
	unauthorized signature or has been altered, (v) without notice of any claim
	to the instrument described in Section 3-306, and (vi)
	without notice that any party has a defense or claim in
	recoupment described in Section 3-305(a).
(b) Notice of discharge of
	a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding,
	is not notice of a defense under subsection (a), but discharge is effective
	against a person who became a holder in due course with
	notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does
	not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim
	to the instrument.
(c) Except to the extent a
	transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder
	in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course
	of an instrument taken (i) by legal process or by
	purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor's sale or similar proceeding,
	(ii) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business
	of the transferor, or (iii) as the successor in interest to an estate or other
	organization.
(d) If, under Section 3-303(a)(1),
	the promise of performance that is the consideration for
	an instrument has been partially performed, the holder
	may assert rights as a holder in due course of
	the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument
	equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised
	performance.
(e) If (i) the person
		entitled to enforce an instrument has only a
		security interest in the instrument and (ii) the person obliged to pay the
		instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that
		may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person
		entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder
		in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at
		the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the
		unpaid obligation secured.
(f) To be effective, notice
	must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity
	to act on it.

It explains that certain circumstances, such as legal process or bulk transactions, can prevent someone from acquiring the rights of a holder in due course. It also sets limitations on the amount a holder in due course can assert if the promise of performance has only been partially fulfilled or if the person entitled to enforce the instrument only has a security interest.

	the promise has been performed;
(2) the transferee acquires a security interest or other
	lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained

	third party by the person taking the instrument.
(b) "Consideration" means
	any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. The drawer or maker of
	an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without
	consideration. If an instrument is issued for a promise of
	performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance
	of the promise is due and the promise has not been performed. If an instrument
	is issued for value as stated in subsection (a), the instrument is also issued

This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines what constitutes value and consideration in the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments. An instrument can be considered issued or transferred for value if there is a promise of performance that has been fulfilled, if it is used as collateral for a security interest, if it is used to settle an antecedent claim, if it is exchanged for another negotiable instrument, or if it is exchanged for an irrevocable obligation to a third party. Consideration is defined as any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract, and the issuer of an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without consideration.

(1) on the day after the day demand for payment is duly
	made;
(2) if the instrument is a check,
	90 days after its date; or
(3) if the instrument is not
	a check, when the instrument has been outstanding for a
	period of time after its date which is unreasonably long under the circumstances
	of the particular case in light of the nature of the instrument and usage of
	the trade.
(b) With respect to an instrument payable
	at a definite time the following rules apply:
(1) If the principal is payable in installments
	and a due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes
	overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment,
	and the instrument remains overdue until the default is cured.
(2) If the principal is not payable in installments
	and the due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes
	overdue on the day after the due date.
(3) If a due date with respect to principal has
	been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on
	the day after the accelerated due date.
(c) Unless the due date of
	principal has been accelerated, an instrument does

In simpler terms, an instrument (e.g. a check) becomes overdue either the day after payment is demanded, 90 days after the check's date, or if it has been outstanding for an unreasonably long time. For instruments with a definite payment date, it becomes overdue either when a payment installment is missed or on the day after the due date. However, if only interest is in default and not the principal, the instrument doesn't become overdue.

	nullifies the obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor
	to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor
	reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or
	(iv) discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings;
(2) a defense of the obligor stated in another section
	of this Article or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing
	a right to payment under a simple contract; and
(3) a claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original
	payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the
	transaction that gave rise to the instrument; but the claim of the obligor may
	be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount
	owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.
(b) The right of a holder
		in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to
		pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the
		obligor stated in subsection (a)(1), but is not subject to defenses of the
		obligor stated in subsection (a)(2) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection
		(a)(3) against a person other than the holder.
(c) Except as stated in subsection
	(d), in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to
	pay the instrument, the obligor may not assert against
	the person entitled to enforce the instrument
	a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument (Section 3-306)
	of another person, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted
	by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts
	the claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument. An obligor
	is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the
	instrument does not have rights of a holder in
	due course and the obligor proves that the instrument
	is a lost or stolen instrument.
(d) In an action to enforce
	the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument,
	the accommodation party may assert against the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under
	subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled
	to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings,
	infancy, and lack of legal capacity.
(e) In a consumer
		transaction, if law other than this article requires that an instrument
		include a statement to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee
		are subject to a claim or defense that the issuer could assert against the
		original payee, and the instrument does not include such a statement: (1) the
		instrument has the same effect as if the instrument included such a statement;
		(2) the issuer may assert against the holder or transferee all claims and defenses
		that would have been available if the instrument included such a statement;
		and (3) the extent to which claims may be asserted against the holder or transferee
		is determined as if the instrument included such a statement. 
(f) This section is subject to law
	other than this article that establishes a different rule for consumer
	transactions. 




‹ § 3-304. OVERDUE	INSTRUMENT.
up
PART 4. LIABILITY OF PARTIES ›





This section outlines the defenses and claims that can be used in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument. The right to enforce the obligation is subject to certain defenses, such as infancy of the obligor, duress, lack of legal capacity, or fraud. Additionally, a claim in recoupment of the obligor may be asserted against the original payee of the instrument if it arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument. 

However, a holder in due course is not subject to defenses or claims in recoupment against a person other than the holder. An obligor cannot assert a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument of another person in an action to enforce the obligation, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted if they are joined in the action and personally assert the claim. 

In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert certain defenses or claims in recoupment that the accommodated party could assert. However, certain defenses are not available, such as discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal capacity. 

In a consumer transaction, if an instrument does not include a statement that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to a claim or defense that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the issuer may assert all claims and defenses that would have been available if the statement was included. This section is subject to other laws that establish different rules for consumer transactions.

A person taking an instrument,

	due course, is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the
	instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to rescind a negotiation and
	to recover the instrument or its proceeds. A person having rights of a holder
	in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.

§ 3-307. NOTICE	OF BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. ›





Summary: This section states that if someone other than a holder in due course takes possession of an instrument (such as a check), they can be subject to a claim of property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds. However, a holder in due course takes the instrument free of any such claims.

Analogy: It's like buying a used car from someone who doesn't actually own it. If you're not a legitimate buyer (holder in due course), you could be subject to a claim from the actual owner (property or possessory right claim).

Commonly referred counterpart: None specifically, but this section is important for anyone involved in transactions involving negotiable instruments, such as checks or promissory notes.

(a) In this section:
(1) "Fiduciary" means
	an agent, trustee, partner, corporate officer or director, or other representative
	owing a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument.
(2) "Represented
		person" means the principal, beneficiary, partnership, corporation,
		or other person to whom the duty stated in paragraph (1) is owed.
(b) If (i) an instrument is
	taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, (ii) the taker
	has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (iii) the represented
	person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the
	transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the following rules
	apply:
(1) Notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary
	is notice of the claim of the represented person.
(2) In the case of an instrument payable
	to the represented person or the fiduciary as such, the taker has notice of
	the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken in payment of or
	as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary,
	(ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit
	of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account other than an account of
	the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.
(3) If an instrument is issued by
	the represented person or the fiduciary as such, and made payable to the fiduciary
	personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless
	the taker knows of the breach of fiduciary duty.
(4) If an instrument is issued by
	the represented person or the fiduciary as such, to the taker as payee, the
	taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken
	in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal
	debt of the fiduciary, (ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be
	for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account
	other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented
	person.

§ 3-308. PROOF	OF SIGNATURES AND STATUS AS HOLDER IN DUE COURSE. ›





This section outlines the rules and notice requirements in cases where an instrument has been taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection, and the represented person makes a claim that the fiduciary breached their duty. If the taker has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, notice of the breach of fiduciary duty is notice of the represented person's claim. The taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is taken in payment of or as security for a debt known to be the personal debt of the fiduciary or taken in a transaction known to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary. However, if an instrument is issued by the represented person or fiduciary and made payable to the fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless they know of the breach.

(a) In an action with respect
	to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority
	to make, each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied
	in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings,
	the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but
	the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is
	to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent
	at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If
	an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed
	principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to
	the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant
	is liable on the instrument as a represented person under
	Section 3-402(a).
(b) If the validity of signatures
	is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection
	(a), a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled
	to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under
	Section 3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or
	claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the
	right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except
	to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder
	in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.

§ 3-309. ENFORCEMENT	OF LOST, DESTROYED, OR STOLEN INSTRUMENT. ›





This section discusses the proof of signatures and status as a holder in due course in an action regarding a financial instrument. The authenticity and authority to make each signature on the instrument is presumed unless specifically denied in the pleadings. The burden of proving validity lies on the person claiming it, but the signature is assumed to be authentic and authorized unless the signer is dead or incompetent. If the action is brought against an undisclosed principal, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant is liable on the instrument. If signatures are proven to be valid and there is compliance with the subsection, the plaintiff is entitled to payment unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. The plaintiff's right to payment is subject to the defense or claim unless they can prove themselves to be a holder in due course.

(a) A person not in possession
	of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument
	if: 
(1) the person seeking to enforce the instrument
(A) was entitled to enforce it the instrument when loss
	of possession occurred, or
(B) has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the
	instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss
	of possession occurred; 
(2) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer
	by the person or a lawful seizure; and
(3) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of
	the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot
	be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a
	person that cannot	be found or is not amenable to service of process. 
(b) A person seeking enforcement
	of an instrument under subsection (a) must prove the
	terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If
	that proof is made, Section 3-308 applies to the case
	as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The
	court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless
	it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected
	against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce
	the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable
	means.

§ 3-310. EFFECT	OF INSTRUMENT ON OBLIGATION FOR WHICH TAKEN. ›





This section explains the circumstances under which a person not in possession of a lost, destroyed, or stolen financial instrument like a check or promissory note can still enforce it. The person seeking enforcement must prove their right to enforce the instrument and that the loss of possession was not due to a transfer or lawful seizure. The court must also ensure that the party required to pay the instrument is protected against any other claims to enforce it. 

In simpler terms, if someone loses a financial instrument and cannot reasonably get it back, someone else can still enforce it as long as they prove they are entitled to do so and the party required to pay the instrument is protected. 

An analogy could be losing a winning lottery ticket and someone else finding it and claiming the prize. The person who lost the ticket can still collect the winnings if they can prove it was their ticket and the lottery commission ensures that the rightful winner is protected. 

Another analogy could be a lost dog that is found by someone else. The original owner can still claim the dog if they can prove it belongs to them and the person who found the dog is protected from any claims by other people who might say the dog is theirs.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed,
	if a certified check, cashier's
	check, or teller's check is taken for an obligation,
	the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an
	amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were
	taken in payment of the obligation. Discharge of the obligation does not
	affect any liability that the obligor may have as an indorser of
	the instrument.
(b) Unless otherwise agreed
	and except as provided in subsection (a), if a note or an
	uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation
	is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount
	of money equal to the amount of the instrument were
	taken, and the following rules apply:
(1) In the case of an uncertified check,
	suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until
	it is paid or certified. Payment or certification of the check results
	in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the amount of the check.
(2) In the case of a note, suspension
	of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid. Payment
	of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4), if the check or note is
	dishonored and the obligee of the obligation for which the instrument was
	taken is the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument, the obligee may enforce either the instrument or the obligation. In
	the case of an instrument of a third person which is negotiated to the obligee
	by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the
	obligation.
(4) If the person
		entitled to enforce the instrument taken for
		an obligation is a person other than the obligee, the obligee may not enforce
		the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended. If the obligee
		is the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession
		of it because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, the obligation may not be
		enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to that
		extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement
		of the instrument.
(c) If an instrument other
	than one described in subsection (a) or (b) is taken for an obligation, the
	effect is (i) that stated in subsection (a) if the instrument is one on which
	a bank is liable as maker or acceptor,
	or (ii) that stated in subsection (b) in any other case.

§ 3-311. ACCORD	AND SATISFACTION BY USE OF INSTRUMENT. ›





This section explains the effects of taking certain types of financial instruments (such as checks or notes) for an obligation. If a certified check, cashier's check, or teller's check is taken, the obligation is discharged to the extent of the amount of the instrument. If an uncertified check or note is taken, the obligation is suspended until the check or note is paid or dishonored, at which point the obligation is discharged to the extent of the payment. The obligee may still enforce the obligation if the check or note is dishonored, but if the person entitled to enforce the instrument is someone other than the obligee, the obligation is only partially enforceable. If an instrument other than those specified is taken, the effect is either that of a certified check (if a bank is liable as maker or acceptor) or that of an uncertified check or note (in any other case). This section also includes rules for enforcing lost, destroyed, or stolen instruments and for using an instrument as payment to satisfy an obligation.

(a) If a person against whom
	a claim is asserted proves that (i) that person in good
	faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as
	full satisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated
	or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant obtained payment of
	the instrument, the following subsections apply.
(b) Unless subsection (c)
	applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that
	the instrument or an accompanying written communication
	contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered
	as full satisfaction of the claim.
(c) Subject to subsection
	(d), a claim is not discharged under subsection (b) if either of the following
	applies:
(1) The claimant, if an organization, proves that
	(i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous
	statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications
	concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered
	as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office,
	or place, and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received
	by that designated person, office, or place.
(2) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that
	within 90 days after payment of the instrument, the
	claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against
	whom the claim is asserted. This paragraph does not apply if the claimant
	is an organization that that sent a statement complying with paragraph (1)(i).
(d) A claim is discharged if the
	person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time
	before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent
	of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation,
	knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.

This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines the conditions under which an instrument, such as a check or promissory note, can be used to satisfy a debt or claim. If a person can prove that they made a good faith effort to offer an instrument as full satisfaction of a claim, and that the claim was either unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, then the claim may be discharged. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule, including if the claimant did not receive the instrument or accompanying communication, or if the person offering the instrument knew that it was being offered as full satisfaction of the claim. This section is important for understanding the legal requirements for using instruments in resolving disputes and debts.

(a) In this section:
(1) "Check" means
	a cashier's check, teller's
	check, or certified check.
(2) "Claimant" means
	a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's
	check, teller's check, or certified
	check that was lost, destroyed, or stolen.
(3) "Declaration of loss" means
	a statement, made in a record under penalty of perjury, to the effect
	that (i) the declarer lost possession of a check, (ii) the declarer is the drawer or
	payee of the check, in the case of a certified	check,
	or the remitter or payee of the check, in the case of a cashier's
	check or teller's check, (iii) the loss of possession
	was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure, and (iv)
	the declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check
	was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful
	possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable
	to service of process.
(4) "Obligated bank" means
	the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's
	check or the acceptor of a certified check.
(b) A claimant may assert
	a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing
	the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of
	the check, if (i) the claimant is the drawer or payee
	of a certified check or the remitter or
	payee of a cashier's check or teller's
	check, (ii) the communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration
	of loss of the claimant with respect to the check, (iii) the communication is
	received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act
	on it before the check is paid, and (iv) the claimant provides reasonable identification
	if requested by the obligated bank. Delivery of a declaration of loss
	is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration. If
	a claim is asserted in compliance with this subsection, the following rules
	apply:
(1) The claim becomes enforceable at the later of
	(i) the time the claim is asserted, or (ii) the 90th day following the date
	of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's
	check, or the 90th day following the date of the acceptance,
	in the case of a certified check.
(2) Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has
	no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check or, in the case of
	a teller's check, may permit the drawee to
	pay the check. Payment to a person
	entitled to enforce the check discharges all liability of the obligated
	bank with respect to the check.
(3) If the claim becomes enforceable before the
	check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the
	check.
(4) When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated
	bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the check to the claimant if payment
	of the check has not been made to a person
	entitled to enforce the check. Subject to Section 4-302(a)(1),
	payment to the claimant discharges all liability of the obligated bank with
	respect to the check.
(c) If the obligated
		bank pays the amount of a check to a claimant under subsection (b)(4) and
		the check is presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder
		in due course, the claimant is obliged to (i) refund the payment to the
		obligated bank if the check is paid, or (ii) pay the amount of the check to
		the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is dishonored.
(d) If a claimant has the
	right to assert a claim under subsection (b) and is also a person
	entitled to enforce a cashier's check, teller's
	check, or certified check which is lost, destroyed,
	or stolen, the claimant may assert rights with respect to the check either under

(1) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously

(2) Subject to subsection (c), if (i) the form of

	capacity or (ii) the represented person is
	not identified in the instrument, the representative
	is liable on the instrument to a holder in due

	not intended to be liable on the instrument. With respect to any other
	person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that
	the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.
(c) If a representative signs
	the name of the representative as drawer of a check without
	indication of the representative status and the check is payable from an account

If a representative signs the name of the represented person or themselves as the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature. If the representative signs their own name but the form of the signature shows it was made on behalf of the represented person, the representative is not liable. However, if the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that it was made in a representative capacity or the represented person is not identified, the representative may be liable to a holder in due course. If a representative signs a check without indication of their representative status but the check is payable from the represented person's account, the signer is not liable.

(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is
	its holder.
(2) An indorsement by

§ 3-405. EMPLOYER’S	RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRAUDULENT INDORSEMENT BY EMPLOYEE. ›





In this section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), it is established that if an impostor or someone impersonating the payee of an instrument convinces the issuer to issue the instrument, any endorsement made by a person in the name of the payee is considered effective if the instrument is paid or taken for value or collection in good faith. Similarly, if the person identified as the payee has no interest in the instrument or is a fictitious person, any endorsement made in the name of the payee is considered effective until the instrument is negotiated by special endorsement. An endorsement is considered to be made in the name of the payee if it is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee or if the instrument is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee. However, if someone paying or taking the instrument fails to exercise ordinary care and that failure contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure contributed to the loss.

	by the employer.
(2) "Fraudulent
		indorsement" means (i) in the case of an instrument payable
		to the employer, a forged indorsement purporting
		to be that of the employer, or (ii) in the case of an instrument with respect
		to which the employer is the issuer, a forged indorsement
		purporting to be that of the person identified as payee.
(3) "Responsibility" with

	if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the
	instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee
	makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument,
	the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of

This section outlines an employer's responsibility for fraudulent endorsements made by their employees. If an employer entrusts an employee with responsibility for an instrument and the employee makes a fraudulent endorsement, the endorsement is effective as the endorsement of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in their name. However, if the person paying the instrument fails to exercise ordinary care and this contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, they may be held liable for the amount of the loss. An endorsement is considered to be made in the name of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in a name substantially similar to that person's name or if the instrument is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that person's name. This section also includes definitions for terms such as "employee" and "responsibility."

If someone fails to exercise ordinary care, they may not be able to assert the alteration or forgery against someone who pays or takes the instrument in good faith. If both parties involved in the transaction fail to exercise ordinary care, any resulting loss is allocated between them based on the extent of their negligence.

This section of the Uniform Commercial Code defines what constitutes an alteration of a negotiable instrument and how it affects the parties involved. An alteration is any unauthorized change to the instrument that modifies the obligation of a party or adds words or numbers to an incomplete instrument. If an alteration is fraudulently made, it discharges the party whose obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. However, if a payor bank or drawee pays a fraudulently altered instrument or a person takes it for value in good faith and without notice of the alteration, they may enforce the instrument according to its original terms or as completed in the case of an unauthorized completion of an incomplete instrument. This section helps ensure the integrity of negotiable instruments and protects parties from fraudulent alterations.

Acceptance can be made at any time and becomes effective when notification is given or the accepted draft is delivered. A draft can still be accepted even if it's incomplete, overdue, or has been dishonored. If a draft is payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails to date the acceptance, the holder may complete the acceptance by supplying a date in good faith. The section also defines a certified check, which is a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn.

If the holder accepts the varying terms, any drawers or endorsers who did not expressly agree to the acceptance are released from their obligations.

	resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages
	under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary

	entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized
	to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled
	to enforce the instrument.
(2) The person making payment may recover from any
	warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses
	and loss of interest resulting from the breach.
(e) The warranties stated
	in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless
	notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30
	days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of

§ 3-418. PAYMENT	OR ACCEPTANCE BY MISTAKE. ›





This section outlines the warranties made by those presenting or transferring unaccepted drafts and instruments for payment or acceptance. The presenter or transferor warrants that they are authorized to enforce or obtain payment on behalf of the holder, that the draft has not been altered, and that they have no knowledge of unauthorized signatures. Drawees may recover damages for breach of warranty, and the right to do so is not affected by their failure to exercise ordinary care. The warranties cannot be disclaimed for checks, and notice of a claim for breach of warranty must be given within 30 days. The cause of action for breach of warranty accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach. If payment or acceptance is made by mistake, Section 3-418 applies.

	(ii) the signature of the drawer of the draft was authorized,
	the drawee may recover the amount of the draft from the person to whom or for

This section outlines the remedies available to a drawee or payer who made a payment or accepted a draft by mistake. They can recover the amount from the person who received the payment or for whose benefit it was made, or revoke the acceptance in the case of a draft. This can be done even if the drawee or payer did not exercise ordinary care in making the payment or accepting the draft. However, these remedies cannot be used against someone who took the instrument in good faith and for value, or who has changed their position in reliance on the payment or acceptance. If payment is recovered or acceptance is revoked, the instrument is treated as dishonored. This section does not limit other remedies provided by other sections of the law.

(a) If an instrument is issued for
	value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument
	("accommodated
	party") and another party to the instrument ("accommodation
	party") signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability
	on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for
	the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for
	accommodation."
(b) An accommodation party
	may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor,
	or indorser and, subject to subsection (d), is obliged
	to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs. The
	obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute
	of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for
	the accommodation.
(c) A person signing an instrument is
	presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument
	is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous
	indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting
	as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to
	the instrument. Except as provided in Section 3-605,
	the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected
	by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument
	was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument
	for accommodation.
(d) If the signature of a party to
	an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously
	that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation
	of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount
	due on the instrument to a person entitled
	to enforce the instrument only if (i) execution of judgment against the
	other party has been returned unsatisfied, (ii) the other party is insolvent
	or in an insolvency proceeding, (iii) the other party cannot be served with
	process, or (iv) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from
	the other party.
(e) If the signature of a party to
	an instrument is accompanied by words indicating that
	the party guarantees payment or the signer signs the instrument as an accommodation
	party in some other manner that does not unambiguously indicate an intention
	to guarantee collection rather than payment, the signer is obliged to pay the
	amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument
	in the same circumstances as the accommodated party would be obliged, without
	prior resort to the accommodated party by the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument.
(f) An accommodation party
	who	pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement
	from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against
	the	accommodated party. In proper circumstances, an accommodation party
	may obtain relief that requires the accommodated party to perform its obligations
	on the instrument. An accommodated party that pays the instrument has no right
	of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation
	party. 




‹ § 3-418. PAYMENT	OR ACCEPTANCE BY MISTAKE.
up
§ 3-420. CONVERSION	OF INSTRUMENT. ›





Summary: This section explains the concept of an "accommodation party" who signs an instrument (such as a check or promissory note) without receiving value from it but for the benefit of another party. It outlines the obligations of the accommodation party to pay the instrument and the circumstances under which they can be held liable. It also explains the rights of the accommodation party to seek reimbursement from the accommodated party and obtain relief if necessary.

An accommodation party is someone who signs an instrument to help out another party without receiving any direct benefit from it. They can sign the instrument as a maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser, and are obligated to pay the instrument in the capacity in which they signed it. The obligation of an accommodation party can be enforced even if there was no consideration received for the accommodation, and even if there is a statute of frauds involved.

If a signature is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as a surety or guarantor for another party's obligation, they are presumed to be an accommodation party. The obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.

However, if the signature is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the signer is guaranteeing collection rather than payment, they are only obliged to pay if certain circumstances arise, such as the other party being insolvent or unable to be served with process.

If the signature does not unambiguously indicate an intention to guarantee collection rather than payment, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument in the same circumstances as the accommodated party.

An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and can enforce the instrument against them. They can also seek relief requiring the accommodated party to perform their obligations on the instrument. However, an accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against or entitlement to contribution from an accommodation party.

(a) The law applicable to
	conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An
	instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation,
	from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains
	payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce
	the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument
	may not be brought by (i) the issuer or acceptor of
	the instrument or (ii) a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the
	instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.
(b) In an action under subsection
	(a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument,
	but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.
(c) A representative, other
	than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt
	with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one
	who was not the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any
	proceeds that it has not paid out.

PART 5. DISHONOR ›





This section discusses the conversion of instruments, which refers to the act of taking an instrument from someone who is not entitled to enforce it. This can include taking the instrument through transfer or payment made by a bank to someone who is not entitled to receive it. The issuer, acceptor, payee, or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument directly or through an agent or co-payee cannot bring an action for conversion. 

If an action is brought under this subsection, the liability measure is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery cannot exceed the plaintiff's interest in the instrument. 

A representative who has acted in good faith on behalf of someone who was not entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion beyond the amount of any proceeds that have not been paid out.

(a) "Presentment" means
	a demand made by or on behalf of a person
	entitled to enforce an instrument (i) to pay the
	instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged
	to pay the instrument or, in the case of a note or accepted draft payable
	at a bank, to the bank, or (ii) to accept a draft made to the drawee.
(b) The following rules are
	subject to Article 4, agreement of the parties, and clearing-house rules and
	the like:
(1) Presentment may be made at the place of payment
	of the instrument and must be made at the place of
	payment if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States; may be
	made by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written, or electronic
	communication; is effective when the demand for payment or acceptance is
	received by the person to whom presentment is made;
	and is effective if made to any one of two or more makers, acceptors, drawees,
	or other payors.
(2) Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is
	made, the person making presentment must (i) exhibit the instrument,
	(ii) give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of
	another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so, and (iii) sign a
	receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if
	full payment is made.
(3) Without dishonoring the instrument,
	the party to whom presentment is
	made may (i) return the instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement,
	or (ii) refuse payment or acceptance for failure of
	the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of
	the parties, or other applicable law or rule.
(4) The party to whom presentment is
	made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day after the day
	of presentment if the party to whom presentment is made has established a cut-off
	hour not earlier than 2 p.m. for the receipt and processing of instruments presented
	for payment or acceptance and presentment is made
	after the cut-off hour.




‹ PART 5. DISHONOR
up
§ 3-502. DISHONOR. ›





In layman's terms, presentment refers to a demand for payment or acceptance of an instrument, such as a check or promissory note, by someone entitled to enforce it. Presentment can be made in various ways and is effective when received by the person to whom it is made. The party receiving presentment may return the instrument for lack of endorsement or refuse payment or acceptance if the terms of the instrument or applicable laws or rules are not met.

Dishonor occurs when the party to whom presentment is made refuses to pay or accept the instrument. This can happen for various reasons, such as insufficient funds or a missing signature. The party making presentment must exhibit the instrument and provide identification and evidence of authority if presenting on behalf of another person. The party to whom presentment is made may establish a cut-off time for processing instruments presented for payment or acceptance. If presentment is made after the cut-off time, the party may treat it as occurring on the next business day.

(a) Dishonor of a note is
	governed by the following rules:
(1) If the note is payable on
	demand, the note is dishonored if presentment is
	duly made to the maker and the note is not paid on the
	day of presentment.
(2) If the note is not payable
	on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment,
	the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid
	on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.
(3) If the note is not payable
	on demand and paragraph (2) does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is
	not paid on the day it becomes payable.
(b) Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other
	than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules:
(1) If a check is duly presented
	for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the
	counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank makes timely return of the
	check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under Section 4-301 or 4-302,
	or becomes accountable for the amount of the check under
	Section 4-302.
(2) If a draft is payable on
	demand and paragraph (1) does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for
	payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not
	paid on the day of presentment.
(3) If a draft is payable on
	a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if (i) presentment for
	payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not
	made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever
	is later, or (ii) presentment for acceptance is duly
	made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted
	on the day of presentment.
(4) If a draft is payable on
	elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance,
	the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance
	is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.
(c) Dishonor of an unaccepted
	documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated
	in subsection (b)(2), (3), and (4), except that payment or acceptance may
	be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business
	day of the drawee following the day on which payment or
	acceptance is required by those paragraphs.
(d) Dishonor of an accepted draft is
	governed by the following rules:
(1) If the draft is payable
	on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for
	payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is
	not paid on the day of presentment.
(2) If the draft is not payable
	on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for
	payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is
	not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever
	is later.
(e) In any case in which presentment is
	otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused
	under Section 3-504, dishonor occurs without presentment
	if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.
(f) If a draft is
	dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft
	was not made and the person entitled to demand acceptance consents to a late
	acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never having
	been dishonored.

This section outlines the rules for dishonor of various types of negotiable instruments, such as notes and drafts. Dishonor occurs when a payment is not made on the day it is required, or when a check is returned or notice of nonpayment is given. If presentment is excused, dishonor can still occur if the instrument is not accepted or paid. However, if a late acceptance is permitted, the draft is treated as if it was never dishonored.

Notice can be given by any person using any commercially reasonable means, as long as it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that it has been dishonored. Return of an instrument given to a bank for collection is sufficient notice. The timing of notice depends on whether the instrument is being collected by a bank or not, with notice required within 30 days of dishonor for all other instruments.

(b) Subject to subsection (e) a note

	if at the time of the payment the party obliged to pay has not received adequate
	notification that the note has been transferred and that payment is to be made
	to the transferee. A notification is adequate only if it is signed by the transferor
	or the transferee; reasonably identifies the transferred note; and provides
	an address at which payments subsequently can be made. Upon request, a transferee
	shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the note has been transferred.
	Unless the transferee complies with the request, a payment to the person that
	formerly was entitled to enforce the note is effective for purposes of subsection
	(c) even if the party obliged to pay the note has received a notification under

(1) a claim to the instrument under
	Section 3-306 is enforceable against the party receiving
	payment and (i) payment is made with knowledge by the payor that payment is

This section explains how payments on instruments, such as notes or checks, are made and how they affect the obligations of the parties involved. Payment is considered made when it is made by the party obliged to pay the instrument to a person entitled to enforce it. Even if the payment is made with knowledge of a claim to the instrument by another person, the obligation of the party obliged to pay is discharged. However, in the case of a note, payment is only considered made to a former holder of the note if the party obliged to pay has not received adequate notification of the transfer. 

If payment is made after the note has been transferred but before the party obliged to pay has received adequate notification, the transferee is deemed to have notice of the payment. However, the obligation to pay is not discharged if a claim to the instrument is enforceable against the party receiving payment, or if the instrument is known to be stolen.

This section also clarifies that "signed" includes electronic symbols, sounds, or processes attached to a record with the intent to adopt or accept it.

Tender of payment also discharges the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered. This section provides clarity on the legal requirements for tender of payment and the rights and obligations of parties involved.

(a) A person
		entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration,
		may discharge the obligation of	a party to pay the instrument
		(i) by an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to
		the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation
		or striking out of the party's signature, or the addition of words to the instrument
		indicating discharge, or (ii) by agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing
		rights against the party	by a signed record.
(b) Cancellation or striking
	out of an indorsement pursuant to subsection (a)
	does not affect the status and rights of a party derived
	from the indorsement.
(c) As used in this section, "signed," with
	respect to a record that is not a writing, includes the attachment to or logical
	association with the record of an electronic symbol, sound, or process to or
	with the record with the present intent to adopt or accept the record.

This section explains that a person who has the right to enforce an instrument can discharge the obligation of a party to pay it by cancelling or renouncing their rights against the party. This can be done through intentional acts like destroying or cancelling the instrument, or agreeing not to sue. Cancelling an endorsement does not affect the status and rights of a party derived from the endorsement. The term "signed" includes electronic signatures.

Page Title: § 3-605. DISCHARGE	OF SECONDARY OBLIGORS.
Tab Content: Primary tabs







(a) If a person
		entitled to enforce an instrument releases the
		obligation of a principal obligor in whole or in part, and another party to
		the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to the obligation of that
		principal obligor, the following rules apply: 
(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary
	obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not
	affected. Unless the terms of the release preserve the secondary obligor's recourse,
	the principal obligor is discharged, to the extent of the release, from any
	other duties to the secondary obligor under this article. 
(2) Unless the terms of the release provide that the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the instrument
	against the secondary obligor, the secondary obligor is discharged to the same
	extent as the principal obligor from any unperformed portion of its obligation
	on the instrument. If the instrument is a check and the obligation of the secondary
	obligor is based on an indorsement of the check, the secondary obligor is discharged
	without regard to the language or circumstances of the discharge or other release. 
(3) If the secondary obligor is not discharged under paragraph
	(2), the secondary obligor is discharged to the extent of the value of the consideration
	for the release, and to the extent that the release would otherwise cause the
	secondary obligor a loss. 
(b) If a person
		entitled to enforce an instrument grants a principal
		obligor an extension of the time at which one or more payments are due on the
		instrument and another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with
		respect	to the obligation of that principal obligor, the following rules apply: 
(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary
	obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not
	affected. Unless the terms of the extension preserve the secondary obligor's
	recourse, the extension correspondingly extends the time for performance of
	any other duties owed to the secondary obligor by the principal obligor under
	this article. 
(2) The secondary obligor is discharged to the extent
	that	the extension would otherwise cause the secondary obligor a loss. 
(3) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged
	under paragraph (2), the secondary obligor may perform its obligations to a
	person entitled to enforce the instrument as if the time for payment had not
	been extended or, unless the terms of the extension provide that the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the instrument
	against the secondary obligor as if the time for payment had not been extended,
	treat the time for performance of its obligations as having been extended correspondingly. 
(c) If a person
		entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with
		or without consideration, to a modification of
		the obligation of a principal obligor other than a complete or partial release
		or an extension of the due date and another party to the instrument is a secondary
		obligor with respect to the obligation of that principal obligor, the following
		rules apply: 
(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary
	obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not
	affected. The modification correspondingly modifies any other duties owed to
	the secondary obligor by the principal obligor under this article. 
(2) The secondary obligor is discharged from any unperformed
	portion of its obligation to the extent that the modification would otherwise
	cause the secondary obligor a loss. 
(3) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged
	under paragraph (2), the secondary obligor may satisfy its obligation on the
	instrument as if the modification had not occurred, or treat its obligation
	on the instrument as having been modified correspondingly. 
(d) If the obligation of a principal
	obligor is secured by an interest in collateral, another party to
	the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to that obligation, and a
	person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest
	in collateral, the obligation of the secondary obligor is discharged to the
	extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired
	to the extent the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the
	amount of the recourse of the secondary obligor, or the reduction in value of
	the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the recourse
	exceeds the value of the interest. For purposes of this subsection, impairing
	the value of an interest in collateral includes failure to obtain or maintain
	perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, release of collateral
	without substitution of collateral of equal value or equivalent reduction of
	the underlying obligation, failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of
	collateral owed, under Article 9 or other law, to a debtor or other person secondarily
	liable, and failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of or otherwise
	enforcing the interest in collateral. 
(e) A secondary obligor is not discharged
	under subsection (a)(3), (b), (c), or (d) unless the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument knows that
	the person is a secondary obligor or has notice under Section 3-419(c) that
	the instrument was signed for accommodation. 
(f) A secondary obligor is not discharged
	under this section if the secondary obligor consents to the event or conduct
	that is the basis of the discharge, or the instrument or a separate agreement
	of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section specifically
	or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship
	or impairment of collateral. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, consent
	by the principal obligor to an act that would lead to a discharge under this
	section constitutes consent to that act by the secondary obligor if the secondary
	obligor controls the principal obligor or deals with the person entitled to
	enforce the instrument on behalf of the principal obligor. 
(g) A release or extension preserves
	a secondary obligor's recourse if the terms of the release or extension provide
	that the person entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce
	the instrument against the secondary obligor; and the recourse of the secondary
	obligor continues as though the release or extension had not been granted. 
(h) Except as otherwise provided
	in subsection (i), a secondary obligor asserting discharge under this section
	has the burden of persuasion both with respect to the occurrence of the acts
	alleged to harm the secondary obligor and loss or prejudice caused by those
	acts. 
(i) If the secondary obligor demonstrates
	prejudice caused by an impairment of its recourse, and the circumstances of
	the case indicate that the amount of loss is not reasonably susceptible of calculation
	or requires proof of facts that are not ascertainable, it is presumed that the
	act impairing recourse caused a loss or impairment equal to the liability of
	the secondary obligor on the instrument. In that event, the burden of persuasion
	as to any lesser amount of the loss is on the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument.

U.C.C. - ARTICLE 4 - BANK DEPOSITS AND COLLECTIONS (2002) ›





This section discusses the discharge of secondary obligors in relation to the release, extension, or modification of the obligation of a principal obligor. It outlines the rules that apply in such scenarios and specifies the circumstances under which a secondary obligor may be discharged from their obligation. It also states that a secondary obligor cannot be discharged if they have consented to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or if the instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral. The burden of persuasion with respect to the occurrence of the acts alleged to harm the secondary obligor and loss or prejudice caused by those acts falls on the secondary obligor.

§ 3-201. NEGOTIATION. ›





§ 3-201 explains the process of negotiation in the context of negotiable instruments. This means that the transfer of ownership of a check, promissory note, or other negotiable instrument can be accomplished through negotiation. The process of negotiation involves the transfer of the instrument from one party to another in such a way that the transferee becomes the owner of the instrument and acquires the rights and obligations associated with it.

§ 3-202 provides that a negotiation may be subject to rescission if the transferor lacked the authority to transfer the instrument or if the transfer was made in breach of a fiduciary duty. This means that if the transfer was not authorized or if there was some impropriety involved in the transfer, the recipient may not acquire valid ownership of the instrument.

§ 3-203 discusses the transfer of negotiable instruments and the rights acquired by the transferee. A transferor who transfers an instrument to a transferee endorses the instrument to the transferee. The transferee acquires all the rights of the transferor and has the power to enforce the instrument against all parties liable on the instrument.

§ 3-204 defines indorsement, which is the act of signing one's name on the back of a negotiable instrument for the purpose of transferring ownership or creating an obligation. Indorsement is an important step in the process of negotiation because it provides evidence of the transfer and helps to prevent fraud.

§ 3-205 describes the different types of indorsement that can be used, including special indorsement, blank indorsement, and anomalous indorsement. A special indorsement restricts the transfer of the instrument to a specific person or entity. A blank indorsement allows the instrument to be transferred to anyone who possesses it. An anomalous indorsement is any indorsement that does not fit into the categories of special or blank indorsement.

§ 3-206 discusses restrictive indorsement, which is an indorsement that restricts the use of the instrument in some way. For example, a restrictive indorsement may require that the instrument be used for a specific purpose or that it not be transferred to a certain person or entity.

§ 3-207 provides that a person who reacquires a negotiable instrument after transferring it may cancel any indorsements made on the instrument. This means that if a person sells an instrument and then later reacquires it, they can cancel any indorsements made on the instrument by writing "cancelled" or a similar word on the instrument.

§ 3-305. DEFENSES AND CLAIMS IN RECOUPMENT.
Certain defenses and claims, such as fraud or breach of contract, may be raised against enforcement of an instrument. The holder must prove they are a holder in due course and took the instrument without notice of any defects.

§ 3-501. PRESENTMENT. ›





Presentment is the act of presenting a negotiable instrument, such as a check or promissory note, to the person obligated to pay it. It must be made within a reasonable time after the instrument is issued or it may be considered untimely. A failure to properly present the instrument can result in a loss of legal rights to payment.

§ 3-502. DISHONOR.
Dishonor occurs when the person obligated to pay a negotiable instrument fails to do so. This usually happens because of insufficient funds or a stop payment order. The holder of the instrument can then take legal action to recover the amount owed.

§ 3-503. NOTICE OF DISHONOR.
If a negotiable instrument is dishonored, the holder must give notice of the dishonor to the parties liable for payment. This notice must be given within a reasonable time after the dishonor and must include the reason for the dishonor. Failure to give timely notice can result in a loss of legal rights to payment.

§ 3-504. EXCUSED PRESENTMENT AND NOTICE OF DISHONOR.
There are certain circumstances where presentment and notice of dishonor can be excused. These include situations where the party liable for payment has waived their right to presentment and notice, or where the party has become insolvent or has died.

§ 3-505. EVIDENCE OF DISHONOR.
To prove that an instrument has been dishonored, the holder must provide evidence of the dishonor. This can include a written notice of dishonor, a bank statement showing insufficient funds, or a stop payment order.

§ 3-602. PAYMENT.
Payment refers to the transfer of funds or other assets to fulfill an obligation related to a negotiable instrument. The payment can be made in various forms, such as cash, check, or electronic transfer. Once payment has been made, the person or entity that made the payment is considered to have fulfilled their obligations related to the instrument.

§ 3-603. TENDER OF PAYMENT.
Tender of payment refers to an offer to fulfill an obligation related to a negotiable instrument. This offer must be made in good faith and must be for the full amount owed. If the offer is accepted, it constitutes a discharge of the person or entity's obligations related to the instrument.

§ 3-604. DISCHARGE BY CANCELLATION OR RENUNCIATION.
Cancellation or renunciation of a negotiable instrument can result in a discharge of the person or entity's obligations related to that instrument. This can happen if the instrument is destroyed or if the holder of the instrument renounces their rights to the instrument.

§ 3-605. DISCHARGE OF SECONDARY OBLIGORS.
Secondary obligors, such as endorsers or guarantors of a negotiable instrument, can also be discharged from their obligations related to the instrument. This can happen through various means, such as payment or discharge of the primary obligor. Once discharged, the secondary obligor is no longer held liable for any transactions related to the instrument.
