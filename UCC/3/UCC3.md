### commentary on ## § 3-101. SHORT	TITLE.


The Uniform Commercial Code - Negotiable Instruments, is a body of law governing the use, issuance, and transfer of negotiable instruments such as checks, promissory notes, and drafts. These financial instruments are unique in that they can be transferred from one party to another, and upon endorsement, the new party becomes the legal owner. This article sets the framework for understanding and interpreting the rules involving these instruments, and is thus a cornerstone in the commercial transactions and banking industries.

In a nutshell, it's a bit like the rule book for a particularly complex game of financial hot potato. The terms and conditions outlined in this article delineate who can pass the potato, under what conditions, and what happens when the music stops (or, more accurately, when the instrument is due). 

Significant timeline events related to the Uniform Commercial Code - Negotiable Instruments, would include its initial adoption by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1952, and its subsequent revisions, most notably in 1990 and 2002. 

In terms of counterparts, similar laws and regulations exist globally to govern negotiable instruments, such as the Bills of Exchange Act in the UK or the Negotiable Instruments Act in India. Although the specific provisions may vary, the underlying principles of transferability and enforceability are common across jurisdictions.

### commentary on ## § 3-102. SUBJECT	MATTER.


This section outlines the scope and applicability of Article 3 - Negotiable Instruments in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). It is intended to apply to negotiable instruments such as checks, notes, and drafts, but not to money, payment orders, and securities, which are covered by other articles. 

Article 3 also allows for the overriding authority of Articles 4 and 9 in case of any conflict. This means that rules and regulations under Articles 4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) and 9 (Secured Transactions) will take precedence if there is any inconsistency.

Finally, this section concedes that regulations and operating circulars from the Federal Reserve System and its Banks can supersede provisions in this Article if there are conflicting details. This acknowledges the influence and regulatory power of the Federal Reserve System in financial matters. 

In simple terms, this section sets the boundaries for what rules apply to what financial instruments, and who gets the final say in case of any discrepancies.

## § 3-104. NEGOTIABLE	INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) Except as provided in
	subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable
	instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to
	pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described
	in the promise or order, if it:
(1) is payable to bearer or to order at
	the time it is issued or first comes into possession of
	a holder;
(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and
(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction
	by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the
	payment of money, but the promise or order may
	contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral
	to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment
	or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of
	any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.

### commentary on ## § 3-104. NEGOTIABLE	INSTRUMENT.


This section defines what a negotiable instrument is and gives examples of different types of negotiable instruments.

(a) A negotiable instrument is an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, which may or may not be accompanied by interest or other charges. It is payable to a bearer or to order, either on demand or at a specific time. It may not require the payer to perform any other actions other than paying the money, but it may include terms related to collateral.

(b) The term "instrument" refers to a negotiable instrument.

(c) An order that meets all the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and is defined as a "check" in subsection (f) is considered both a negotiable instrument and a check.

(d) A promise or order is not considered a negotiable instrument if it explicitly states that it is not negotiable or not governed by this Article.

(e) An instrument is a "note" if it's a promise and a "draft" if it's an order. If it falls under both definitions, it can be treated as either.

(f) A "check" is a draft payable on demand and drawn on a bank, or a cashier's or teller's check.

(g) A "cashier's check" is a draft where the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.

(h) A "teller's check" is a draft drawn by a bank on another bank, or payable at or through a bank.

(i) A "traveler's check" is an instrument that is payable on demand, drawn on or payable at or through a bank, labeled as a "traveler's check" or a similar term, and requires a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.

(j) A "certificate of deposit" is an instrument where a bank acknowledges receipt of a sum of money and promises to repay that sum. It is considered a note of the bank. 

In simpler terms, this section outlines what counts as a negotiable instrument, such as checks, notes, drafts, and certificates of deposit. These instruments must meet certain criteria to be considered as such, and there are exceptions and specific conditions for each type.

## § 3-105. ISSUE	OF INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) "Issue" means
	the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer,
	whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument
	to any person.
(b) An unissued instrument,
	or an unissued incomplete instrument that
	is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer,
	but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued
	or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure
	of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.
(c) "Issuer" applies
	to issued and unissued instruments and
	means a maker or drawer of an instrument.




‹ § 3-104. NEGOTIABLE	INSTRUMENT.
up
§ 3-106. UNCONDITIONAL	PROMISE OR ORDER. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-105. ISSUE	OF INSTRUMENT.


(a) "Issue" refers to the initial distribution of a financial instrument by its creator, whether to a holder or nonholder, with the intention of giving rights to someone on that instrument.

(b) An unissued instrument or an unissued incomplete instrument that gets completed binds the maker or drawer to it, but the maker can argue nonissuance as a defense. A conditionally issued instrument or one issued for a specific purpose also binds the maker or drawer, but if the condition is not met or the special purpose is not fulfilled, this can be used as a defense.

(c) The term "issuer" applies to both issued and unissued instruments and refers to the creator of a financial instrument.

In simpler terms, this section explains what it means to issue a negotiable instrument, the obligations and rights of the issuer, and the defenses that can be used in case of unissued, incomplete, or conditionally issued instruments.


---

## § 3-106. UNCONDITIONAL	PROMISE OR ORDER.


Primary tabs







(a) Except as provided in
	this section, for the purposes of Section 3-104(a), a promise or order is
	unconditional unless it states (i) an express condition to payment, (ii) that
	the promise or order is subject to or governed by another record, or (iii) that
	rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another
	record. A reference to another record does not of itself make the promise
	or order conditional.
(b) A promise or order is
	not made conditional (i) by a reference to another record for a statement of
	rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (ii) because
	payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.
(c) If a promise or order requires,
	as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature
	appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or
	order conditional for the purposes of Section 3-104(a). If
	the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails
	to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the
	obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent
	a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.
(d) If a promise or order at
	the time it is issued or first comes into possession of
	a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative
	law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to
	claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against
	the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for
	the purposes of Section 3-104(a); but if the promise
	or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder
	in due course of the instrument.

§ 3-107. INSTRUMENT	PAYABLE IN FOREIGN MONEY. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-106. UNCONDITIONAL	PROMISE OR ORDER.


This section of the law pertains to a promise or order being unconditional in context of a negotiable instrument. 

Subsection (a) explains that a promise or order is considered unconditional unless it explicitly states a condition to payment, is subject to another record, or the rights or obligations are mentioned in another record. Simply referencing another record does not make the promise or order conditional.

Subsection (b) states that a promise or order is not conditional if it refers to another record for rights related to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or if payment is limited to a particular fund or source.

Subsection (c) details that if a promise or order requires a countersignature for payment, it does not make the promise or order conditional. However, if the person doesn't countersign, it could be a defense for the issuer but it doesn't prevent a transferee from becoming a holder of the instrument.

Subsection (d) mentions that a promise or order is not conditional if it includes a statement required by law that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that could be asserted by the issuer against the original payee. However, if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.

In essence, this section details the circumstances under which a promise or order is considered unconditional in context of financial instruments. It also explains the scenarios where the lack of a countersignature or the presence of certain legal statements do not make a promise or order conditional.

## § 3-107. INSTRUMENT	PAYABLE IN FOREIGN MONEY.


Primary tabs







Unless the instrument otherwise
	provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in foreign money may
	be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated
	by using the current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the
	purchase of dollars on the day on which the instrument is paid.




‹ § 3-106. UNCONDITIONAL	PROMISE OR ORDER.
up
§ 3-108. PAYABLE	ON DEMAND OR AT DEFINITE TIME. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-107. INSTRUMENT	PAYABLE IN FOREIGN MONEY.


This law primarily focuses on any financial instrument (such as checks, drafts, notes, or bonds) that stipulates an amount payable in foreign currency. It states that unless specified otherwise within the document, this amount can be paid either in the foreign currency or in an equivalent amount in US dollars. The conversion from the foreign currency to US dollars should be calculated using the current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment on the day the instrument is paid. 

This is an important regulation because it ensures flexibility and fairness in transactions involving foreign currencies. It protects parties involved in such transactions from potential losses due to fluctuating exchange rates. 

In simpler terms, if you owe someone money in a foreign currency (as mentioned in a financial instrument), you have the option to pay either in that currency, or in US dollars. The conversion from the foreign currency to the US dollar amount will be based on the exchange rate on the day you make the payment.


---

## § 3-108. PAYABLE	ON DEMAND OR AT DEFINITE TIME.


Primary tabs







(a) A promise or order is "payable
		on demand" if it (i) states that it is payable on demand or at
		sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the holder,
		or (ii) does not state any time of payment.
(b) A promise or order is "payable
		at a definite time" if it is payable on elapse of a definite period
		of time after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date
		or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the promise
		or order is issued, subject to rights of (i) prepayment,
		(ii) acceleration, (iii) extension at the option of the holder, or (iv) extension
		to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or
		automatically upon or after a specified act or event.
(c) If an instrument,
	payable at a fixed date, is also payable upon demand made before the fixed date,
	the instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for
	payment is not made before that date, becomes payable at a definite time on
	the fixed date.




‹ § 3-107. INSTRUMENT	PAYABLE IN FOREIGN MONEY.
up
§ 3-109. PAYABLE	TO BEARER OR TO ORDER. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-108. PAYABLE	ON DEMAND OR AT DEFINITE TIME.


This section of law explains the definitions and conditions of "payable on demand" and "payable at a definite time" in the context of financial obligations.

(a) An obligation is considered "payable on demand" if it explicitly states so, or if it doesn't mention a specific time of payment. Essentially, the holder can ask for payment at any time.

(b) An obligation is "payable at a definite time" if it is due after a specific period has passed or on a set date. This can be altered with rights of prepayment (paying early), acceleration (speeding up the payment), extension at the holder's decision, or extension to another definite time at the decision of the one originally supposed to pay or after a particular event occurs.

(c) If a financial obligation that is payable on a fixed date also has a condition that it can be demanded before the fixed date, then it is considered payable on demand until the fixed date. If no demand for payment was made before the fixed date, the obligation becomes payable on the fixed date.

This might be compared to a contract between a landlord and tenant, where rent is "payable at a definite time" (the end of the month), but could also be "payable on demand" if the tenant decided to pay early. Similarly, a loan might be "payable on demand" if it contains no specified payment date, giving the lender the right to ask for repayment at any time.


---

## § 3-109. PAYABLE	TO BEARER OR TO ORDER.


Primary tabs







(a) A promise or order is
	payable to bearer if it:
(1) states that it is payable to bearer or to the order of
	bearer or otherwise indicates that the person in possession of the promise or
	order is entitled to payment;
(2) does not state a payee; or
(3) states that it is payable to or to the order of
	cash or otherwise indicates that it is not payable to an identified person.
(b) A promise or order that
	is not payable to bearer is payable to order if it is payable (i) to the order
	of an identified person or (ii) to an identified person or order. A promise
	or order that is payable to order is payable to the identified person.
(c) An instrument payable
	to bearer may become payable to an identified person if it is specially indorsed
	pursuant to Section 3-205(a). An instrument payable
	to an identified person may become payable to bearer if it is indorsed in blank
	pursuant to Section 3-205(b).

up
§ 3-110. IDENTIFICATION	OF PERSON TO WHOM INSTRUMENT IS PAYABLE. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-109. PAYABLE	TO BEARER OR TO ORDER.


This section of the law specifies the different ways an order or promise can be made payable. 

Subsection (a) states that an order or promise is payable to the bearer if it explicitly states so, doesn't specify a payee, or indicates that it's not meant for a specific person.

Subsection (b) states that if an order or promise isn't specified as payable to the bearer, it's payable to an order if it's explicitly stated to be payable to an identified person or to their order.

Subsection (c) explains that an instrument payable to the bearer may become payable to an identified person if it's specifically endorsed under Section 3-205(a). Conversely, an instrument payable to an identified person can become payable to the bearer if it's endorsed in blank under Section 3-205(b).

In layman's terms, this section of the law is essentially detailing how orders or promises for payment can be directed, either to specific people, to whoever might be holding the order or promise, or to cash. It also outlines the process for changing who an order or promise is payable to. 

This law can be used in various financial transactions, including checks, promissory notes, and other negotiable instruments like bonds or drafts. It is particularly pertinent in situations where there is uncertainty or dispute about who is entitled to payment.

## § 3-110. IDENTIFICATION	OF PERSON TO WHOM INSTRUMENT IS PAYABLE.


Primary tabs







(a) The person to whom an instrument is
	initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not
	authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of
	the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the
	signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other
	identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one
	person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the
	signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to
	any person intended by one or more of the signers.
(b) If the signature of the issuer of
	an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the
	payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied
	the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.
(c) A person to whom an instrument is
	payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number,
	office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of
	an instrument, the following rules apply:
(1) If an instrument is
	payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument
	is payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument
	is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the
	instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the
	owner of the account identified by number.
(2) If an instrument is
	payable to:
(i) a trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee
	or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is
	payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether
	or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;
(ii) a person described as agent or similar representative
	of a named or identified person, the instrument is
	payable to the represented person, the representative,
	or a successor of the representative;
(iii) a fund or organization that is not a legal entity,
	the instrument is payable to a representative of the
	members of the fund or organization; or
(iv) an office or to a person described as holding an
	office, the instrument is payable to the named person,
	the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.
(d) If an instrument is
	payable to two or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and
	may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession
	of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons
	not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged,
	or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two or more
	persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively,
	the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.

### commentary on ## § 3-110. IDENTIFICATION	OF PERSON TO WHOM INSTRUMENT IS PAYABLE.


This section of the law outlines the identification of the person to whom an instrument (like a check or promissory note) is payable. 

(a) The person to whom the instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the signer. Even if the person is identified by a different name on the instrument, it is still payable to the person intended by the signer. If multiple people sign the instrument and they don't all intend the same person as the payee, then the instrument is payable to any person intended by any of the signers.

(b) If the instrument is signed by automated means, the payee is determined by the intent of the person who provided the payee's name or identification.

(c) The person to whom the instrument is payable can be identified in any way including by name, identifying number, office, or account number. The law details how the payee is determined if the instrument is payable to an account, a trust, a person represented as an agent, a non-legal entity, or an office.

(d) If the instrument is payable to two or more persons, the law outlines how it can be negotiated, discharged, or enforced depending on whether the persons are named alternatively or not. If the instrument is ambiguous about whether it's payable to the persons alternatively, it is treated as if it is. 

In simple terms, this law section is like a rule book for identifying who gets the money when a check or similar financial document is signed. Whether signed by hand, by machine, or made out to a group or an account, this law provides the guidelines to determine who the rightful payee is.

## § 3-111. PLACE	OF PAYMENT.


Primary tabs







Except as otherwise provided for items in Article 4, an instrument is
	payable at the place of payment stated in the instrument. If no place
	of payment is stated, an instrument is payable at the address of the drawee or maker stated
	in the instrument. If no address is stated, the place of payment is the
	place of business of the drawee or maker. If a drawee or maker has more
	than one place of business, the place of payment is any place of business of
	the drawee or maker chosen by the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument. If the drawee or maker has no
	place of business, the place of payment is the residence of the drawee or maker.

§ 3-112. INTEREST. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-111. PLACE	OF PAYMENT.


This section of the law is about where an instrument, such as a check or promissory note, is to be paid. If a specific place of payment is mentioned in the instrument, then it must be paid there. If no place of payment is specified, then the payment should be made at the address of the person or business who needs to pay (called the "drawee" or "maker"). If no address is specified, then payment can be made at the drawee or maker's place of business. If the drawee or maker has multiple business locations, the person who is owed the money (the "enforcee") can choose which location to go to for payment. If the drawee or maker doesn't have a place of business, then the payment should be made at their residence.

In simpler terms, this law is saying: "Payment should be made where it's said to be made. If no place was specified, go to the address of the person who owes the money. If there's no address, go to their place of business. If they have multiple businesses, you can choose which one to go to. If they don't have a business, go to their home." 

This law might come into play, for example, if a business gives you a check but it bounces. The law would dictate where you can go to try and get the money you're owed.

## § 3-112. INTEREST.









(a) Unless otherwise provided
	in the instrument, (i) an instrument is not payable
	with interest, and (ii) interest on an interest-bearing instrument is payable
	from the date of the instrument.
(b) Interest may be stated
	in an instrument as a fixed or variable amount of
	money or it may be expressed as a fixed or variable rate or rates. The
	amount or rate of interest may be stated or described in the instrument in any
	manner and may require reference to information not contained in the instrument. If
	an instrument provides for interest, but the amount of interest payable cannot
	be ascertained from the description, interest is payable at the judgment rate
	in effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest
	first accrues.




‹ § 3-111. PLACE	OF PAYMENT.
up
§ 3-113. DATE	OF INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-112. INTEREST.


This section sets out the rules regarding interest on an instrument (a document guaranteeing or evidencing payment or debt). 

According to part (a), an instrument does not automatically come with an interest payment unless it is specifically mentioned in the instrument. If an instrument does carry interest, it begins to accrue from the date the instrument was issued.

Subsection (b) allows for flexibility in defining interest. It can be a fixed or variable amount, or a fixed or variable rate. The instrument may require referring to external information to calculate the interest. However, if the amount of interest is unclear from the instrument, the interest rate defaults to the judgement rate applicable at the place and time when the interest begins to accrue.

This section is followed by § 3-113, which deals with the date of the instrument. Prior to this section is § 3-111, which covers the place of payment for the instrument.

To put it in everyday terms, this law is like saying that you don't have to pay any extra rent unless it's written in your lease. If your lease does have a late fee, it starts from the day you were supposed to pay. The fee could be a set amount, a changing amount, or a percentage. If the late fee isn't clear, it defaults to whatever the local laws say about late fees. The specifics about when your lease started and where you have to pay your rent are covered in other parts of your lease agreement.

## § 3-113. DATE	OF INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) An instrument may
	be antedated or postdated. The date stated determines the time of payment
	if the instrument is payable at a fixed period after date. Except as provided
	in Section 4-401(c),
	an instrument payable on demand is not payable before the date of the instrument.
(b) If an instrument is
	undated, its date is the date of its issue or, in the case
	of an unissued instrument, the date it first comes into possession of a holder.




‹ § 3-112. INTEREST.

§ 3-114. CONTRADICTORY	TERMS OF INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-113. DATE	OF INSTRUMENT.


This law stipulates that legal documents (instruments) can be written to take effect on a later (postdated) or earlier (antedated) date than the one on which they are signed. However, it also states that if a document does not have a date, its effective date would be the day it was issued or, if it was not issued, the day it first comes into the possession of a holder. The date is significant because it defines the timeline for payment if the instrument specifies a payment period after a certain date. In the absence of explicit exceptions, an on-demand payment cannot be requested before the date stated in the instrument. 

In simpler terms, this law is like saying you can write a check with today's date (antedating), tomorrow's date (postdating), or no date at all. If it is postdated, the payment isn't due until the date written on the check. If it is undated, the date of issue or the date a holder received it becomes the effective date. However, you can't demand someone pays you before the date on a check unless there's a specific rule allowing it.

	terms, typewritten terms prevail over printed terms, handwritten terms prevail
	over both, and words prevail over numbers.

§ 3-115. INCOMPLETE	INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-114. CONTRADICTORY	TERMS OF INSTRUMENT.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code is addressing situations where an instrument, such as a contract or legal document, contains conflicting information. If there are contradictory terms, it dictates a hierarchy in terms of which terms take precedence. 

In short, the section says that if the document has conflicting terms, then the typewritten terms are considered the most valid over printed terms. However, if there are handwritten terms, they take precedence over both typewritten and printed terms. Finally, if there's a conflict between words and numbers, the words are considered the overriding terms.

An analogy for this rule might be considering the terms like layers of a cake. The base layer, or the least significant, would be the printed terms. The next layer are the typewritten terms, which hold more weight. The top layer, the most important one, is the handwritten terms. And just to add a cherry on top, if there's a dispute between words and numbers, the words always win.

A summary of this section is: In a legal document, if there are conflicting terms, the handwritten terms are considered the most valid, followed by typewritten terms, and then printed terms. Also, words always have precedence over numbers.

## § 3-115. INCOMPLETE	INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) "Incomplete
		instrument" means a signed writing, whether or not issued by
		the signer, the contents of which show at the time of signing that it is incomplete
		but that the signer intended it to be completed by the addition of words or
		numbers.
(b) Subject to subsection
	(c), if an incomplete instrument is an instrument under
	Section 3-104, it may be enforced according to its terms
	if it is not completed, or according to its terms as augmented by completion. If
	an incomplete instrument is not an instrument under Section 3-104,
	but, after completion, the requirements of Section 3-104 are
	met, the instrument may be enforced according to its terms as augmented by completion.
(c) If words or numbers are
	added to an incomplete instrument without authority of the signer, there is
	an alteration of the incomplete instrument under Section 3-407.
(d) The burden of establishing
	that words or numbers were added to an incomplete instrument without authority
	of the signer is on the person asserting the lack of authority.

§ 3-116. JOINT	AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; CONTRIBUTION. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-115. INCOMPLETE	INSTRUMENT.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code defines what constitutes an "incomplete instrument" and sets forth the rules for its enforcement. 

Subsection (a) defines an incomplete instrument as a signed writing which, at the time of signing, was incomplete but intended to be completed by the addition of words or numbers. This could be anything from a check missing a date, a contract missing a term, or any other signed document that is incomplete at the time of signing. 

Subsection (b) provides that if an incomplete instrument meets the criteria of an "instrument" under Section 3-104, it can be enforced as is, or as completed. If the incomplete instrument is not an instrument under Section 3-104 but becomes one upon completion, it can be enforced as completed.

Subsection (c) clarifies that if words or numbers are added to an incomplete instrument without the authority of the signer, this constitutes an alteration of the incomplete instrument under Section 3-407. Essentially, unauthorized changes to a signed but incomplete document are considered alterations and may affect the validity of the document.

Finally, subsection (d) establishes that the person claiming that unauthorized alterations were made to an incomplete document bears the burden of proving this claim. This means that if someone claims an incomplete document was altered without the signer's permission, it's up to them to prove it.

These provisions are designed to provide clarity and security in transactions involving incomplete documents, by setting out the rules for how these documents can be completed and enforced.

## § 3-116. JOINT	AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; CONTRIBUTION.


Primary tabs







(a) Except as otherwise provided
	in the instrument, two or more persons who have the
	same liability on an instrument as makers, drawers, acceptors, indorsers who
	indorse as joint payees, or anomalous indorsers are
	jointly and severally liable in the capacity in which they sign.
(b) Except as provided in
	Section 3-419(e) or by agreement of the affected parties,
	a party having joint and several liability who pays the instrument is
	entitled to receive from any party having the same joint and several liability
	contribution in accordance with applicable law.




‹ § 3-115. INCOMPLETE	INSTRUMENT.
up
§ 3-117. OTHER	AGREEMENTS AFFECTING INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-116. JOINT	AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; CONTRIBUTION.


This section of the law outlines the conditions for joint and several liability for parties involved in a financial instrument, such as a check or promissory note. 

Under subsection (a), multiple parties that share the same liability on an instrument - for example, as joint makers, drawers, acceptors, or endorsers - are jointly and severally liable. This means that each party is individually responsible for the full amount due, but if one party pays more than their share, they can seek contribution from the others.

Subsection (b) provides that a party who has paid the instrument can seek contribution from any other party with the same joint and several liability, unless otherwise agreed or as provided in Section 3-419(e).

In simpler terms, think of this law as a group dinner scenario. Everyone is responsible for paying the bill (jointly and severally liable). If one person ends up paying the full bill, they can ask the others to pay them back for their share (contribution). However, if everyone agreed beforehand that one person would cover the bill, or there is another law that says otherwise, then the person who paid can't ask for payback.

Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof
	of contemporaneous or previous agreements, the obligation of a party to
	an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified,
	supplemented, or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument, if the instrument is issued or
	the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same
	transaction giving rise to the agreement. To the extent an obligation
	is modified, supplemented, or nullified by an agreement under this section,
	the agreement is a defense to the obligation.




‹ § 3-116. JOINT	AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; CONTRIBUTION.
up
§ 3-118. STATUTE	OF LIMITATIONS. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-117. OTHER	AGREEMENTS AFFECTING INSTRUMENT.


This section stipulates that a party's obligation to pay under a financial instrument may be altered, added to, or nullified by a separate agreement between the party due to pay (obligor) and the individual or entity that is entitled to enforce the payment of the instrument. This is only the case if the instrument was issued or the obligation was incurred based on that separate agreement or as part of the same transaction that led to the agreement. In such circumstances, the separate agreement can serve as a defense to the obligation.

It is important to note that this rule is subject to applicable laws that exclude proof of contemporaneous or previous agreements. This means that the law might not permit the introduction of evidence to prove the existence of such contemporaneous or previous agreements. 

This section could be likened to a scenario where a borrower (obligor) and a lender (person entitled to enforce the instrument) agree independently that the borrower's obligation to repay a loan can be reduced if the borrower completes certain tasks for the lender. If the loan was given based on this agreement or as part of the same transaction, this agreement could be used as a defense by the borrower to reduce their obligation to repay the loan.

Comparatively, this is similar to a clause within a contract that modifies the obligations of the parties based on a separate agreement. For instance, a rent-to-own contract might stipulate that the tenant's obligation to pay rent can be reduced by an agreement to make improvements to the property. 

In terms of timeline events, this section would likely come into play after the issuance of the instrument and the creation of the separate agreement, but before the obligation is due to be fulfilled. 

This section is preceded by § 3-116 which addresses joint and several liabilities and contribution, and is followed by § 3-118 which outlines the statute of limitations.

	years after the demand. If no demand for payment is made to the maker,
	an action to enforce the note is barred if neither principal nor interest on
	the note has been paid for a continuous period of 10 years.
(c) Except as provided in
	subsection (d), an action to enforce the obligation of a party to
	an unaccepted draft to pay the draft must be commenced
	within three years after dishonor of the draft or 10 years after the date of
	the draft, whichever period expires first.
(d) An action to enforce the

	of deposit to pay the instrument must be commenced
	within six years after demand for payment is made to the maker,
	but if the instrument states a due date and the maker is not required to pay
	before that date, the six-year period begins when a demand for payment is in
	effect and the due date has passed.
(f) An action to enforce the

(g) Unless governed by other
	law regarding claims for indemnity or contribution, an action (i) for conversion
	of an instrument, for money had and received, or like
	action based on conversion, (ii) for breach of warranty, or (iii) to enforce
	an obligation, duty, or right arising under this Article and not governed by

a) If someone owes you money as per a specific date on a note, you have six years from that due date to take legal action to enforce payment. If the due date is sped up, you have six years from the new due date.

b) If you've demanded payment from the person who owes you and they haven't paid, you have six years from your demand to take them to court. If you haven't demanded payment, you can't take legal action if there has been no payment of principal or interest for a continuous 10-year period.

c) If someone owes you money on an undelivered draft, you have three years from the date the draft was dishonored or 10 years from the date of the draft (whichever comes first) to take legal action.

d) If you're trying to enforce payment from the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a teller's, cashier's, or traveler's check, you have three years from the time you demanded payment to take them to court.

e) If you're trying to enforce payment from someone who owes you money on a certificate of deposit, you have six years from your demand for payment. But if the certificate states a due date and the person isn't required to pay before then, the six-year period begins when your demand for payment is active and the due date has passed.

f) If you're trying to enforce payment from someone who owes you money on an accepted draft (not a certified check), you have six years from the due date or the date of acceptance (depending on whether the obligation is payable at a specific time or on demand).

g) For actions involving conversion of an instrument, breach of warranty, or enforcement of rights under this Article not covered by this section, you have three years from when the cause of action occurs. This doesn't apply if other laws regarding indemnity or contribution claims apply.

In an action for breach of an obligation for which a third
	person is answerable over pursuant to this Article or Article 4, the defendant
	may give the third person notice of the litigation in a record, and the person
	notified may then give similar notice to any other person who is answerable

	defend and (ii) that failure to do so will bind the person notified in an action
	later brought by the person giving the notice as to any determination of fact
	common to the two litigations, the person notified is so bound unless after
	seasonable receipt of the notice the person notified does come in and defend.

PART 2. NEGOTIATION, TRANSFER, AND	INDORSEMENT ›







### commentary on ## § 3-119. NOTICE	OF RIGHT TO DEFEND ACTION.


This regulation provides for the right of a defendant, in a case involving a breach of obligation for which a third party is responsible, to notify the third party of the pending litigation in writing. This third party may then pass on similar notices to any other parties who are liable. The notice must clearly state that the notified party has the right to come in and defend the case, and that their failure to do so could potentially bind them in any future action brought about by the party giving the notice, especially in matters of factual determination common to both litigations. This implies that the notified party would be bound by the facts determined in the original lawsuit if they fail to participate in the defense. However, if the notified party does participate in the defense after receiving the notice in a timely manner, they would not be so bound.

In simple terms, this law gives the defendant the right to pull in any third parties who may share liability in the case and warn them that the judgement could affect them too, unless they participate in the defense. It's like telling your friends, "Hey, you're in this too. If you don't show up and fight, you'll have to accept whatever decision is made." And if they do show up after being notified, they can influence the outcome.

(a) "Negotiation" means
	a transfer of possession, whether voluntary or involuntary, of an instrument by
	a person other than the issuer to a person who thereby
	becomes its holder.
(b) Except for negotiation by
	a remitter, if an instrument is
	payable to an identified person, negotiation requires transfer of possession
	of the instrument and its indorsement by the holder. If
	an instrument is payable to bearer, it may be negotiated by transfer of possession
	alone.

up
§ 3-202. NEGOTIATION	SUBJECT TO RESCISSION. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-201. NEGOTIATION.


"Skeptical and mildly jaded" analogies and summaries:

- Basically, "negotiation" is just a fancy way of saying "handing over." You, who are not the person who issued the instrument (like a check or promissory note), give it to someone else, and voila, they're now the holder of that instrument. 
- There are some exceptions, though. If the instrument was made payable to a specific person, you can't just hand it over. You also have to indorse, or sign, it. If it's payable to bearer (meaning whoever holds it), you can just hand it over without signing it. 

Significant timeline events or commonly referred counterparts:

- The concept of "negotiation" in this context comes from the Uniform Commercial Code, a set of laws governing commercial transactions in the United States. It's been around for decades and is a fundamental part of how business is done.
- A related concept is "transfer," which is another way an instrument can change hands. However, while negotiation usually makes the new holder the owner of the instrument, a transfer doesn't necessarily do so. 
- Indorsement is also a key term here. This is where the holder of the instrument signs it, often on the back, to make the negotiation valid. If an instrument is payable to a specific person, it must be indorsed for the negotiation to be valid.

§ 3-203. TRANSFER	OF INSTRUMENT; RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY TRANSFER. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-202. NEGOTIATION	SUBJECT TO RESCISSION.


This section of the law explains that a negotiation can still be effective even if it is obtained under less than ideal circumstances, such as from someone without legal capacity to negotiate, through illegal means, by fraud or duress, or even in breach of duty. However, the law also clarifies that such negotiation can be rescinded or subjected to other remedies as permitted by law. 

It is important to note that these legal remedies cannot be asserted against a holder in due course or a person who pays the instrument in good faith and without knowledge of the circumstances that form a basis for rescission or other remedies. In simpler terms, if someone receives or pays something in good faith, without knowledge of any wrongdoing, they should not be punished or held responsible for the initial wrong.

In a layman's analogy, this is akin to buying a car from a seller who, unbeknownst to you, had stolen the car. You, as the buyer, acted in good faith with no knowledge of the car's illegal history. As such, any legal action to reclaim the car would not fall on you, but on the original thief.

## § 3-203. TRANSFER	OF INSTRUMENT; RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY TRANSFER.


Primary tabs







(a) An instrument is
	transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer
	for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce
	the instrument.
(b) Transfer of an instrument,
	whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests
	in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including
	any right as a holder in due course, but the
	transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly
	or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud
	or illegality affecting the instrument.
(c) Unless otherwise agreed,
	if an instrument is transferred for value and the
	transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by
	the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified
	indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of
	the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.
(d) If a transferor purports
	to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of
	the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under
	this Article and has only the rights of a partial assignee.

### commentary on ## § 3-203. TRANSFER	OF INSTRUMENT; RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY TRANSFER.


(a) A transfer of an instrument happens when a non-issuer person hands it over to another person, giving them the right to enforce the instrument.

(b) The act of transferring an instrument gives the transferee any rights the transferor had to enforce the instrument, including the rights of a holder in due course. However, if the transferee has engaged in fraud or illegal activities related to the instrument, they cannot acquire the rights of a holder in due course from a holder in due course, whether the transfer is direct or indirect.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred in exchange for value and the transferee does not become a holder due to the transferor failing to indorse the instrument, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor. However, the negotiation of the instrument does not happen until the indorsement is made.

(d) If a transferor tries to transfer less than the entire instrument, the negotiation of the instrument does not happen. The transferee does not get any rights under this Article and only has the rights of a partial assignee.

(Skeptically and mildly jadedly, one might say that this section is about how to properly transfer an instrument. It covers the rights transferred, the need for endorsement, and what happens if the transfer isn't done correctly or completely. Milestone events here could include the initial delivery of the instrument, the potential need for endorsement, and the potential fallout of a partial or fraudulent transfer.)

## § 3-204. INDORSEMENT.









(a) "Indorsement" means
	a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer,
	or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words
	is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating
	the instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser's liability
	on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and
	its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms
	of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously
	indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For
	the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper
	affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.
(b) "Indorser" means
	a person who makes an indorsement.
(c) For the purpose of determining
	whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder,
	an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective
	as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.
(d) If an instrument is
	payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement
	may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's
	name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying
	or taking the instrument for value or collection.

### commentary on ## § 3-204. INDORSEMENT.


This section discusses the definition, conditions, and implications of an indorsement, a term used in commercial law regarding negotiable instruments like cheques or promissory notes.

(a) Indorsement is defined as a signature (not that of the maker, drawer, or acceptor) on an instrument with the intent of negotiating the instrument, restricting its payment, or incurring liability on it. The signature, along with any accompanying words, is considered an indorsement unless there is clear evidence to suggest it was made for a different purpose. A paper attached to the instrument is considered a part of the instrument for determining the presence of a signature.

(b) The term 'Indorser' is defined as a person who makes an indorsement.

(c) If an indorsement transfers a security interest in the instrument, it is considered as an unqualified indorsement for determining if the transferee of the instrument is a holder, i.e., a person in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce it.

(d) If an instrument is payable to a holder under a different name, the holder can make an indorsement using the name on the instrument, their own name, or both. However, a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection may require a signature in both names.

In essence, this section outlines the legal parameters of indorsement, which plays a crucial role in the transfer and negotiation of negotiable instruments in commercial dealings.

## § 3-205. SPECIAL	INDORSEMENT; BLANK INDORSEMENT; ANOMALOUS INDORSEMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) If an indorsement is
	made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable
	to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies
	a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special
	indorsement." When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes
	payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement
	of that person. The principles stated in Section 3-110 apply
	to special indorsements.
(b) If an indorsement is
	made by the holder of an instrument and it is not
	a special indorsement, it is a "blank
	indorsement." When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes
	payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until
	specially indorsed.
(c) The holder may convert
	a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement
	by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words
	identifying the person to whom the instrument is made
	payable.
(d) "Anomalous
		indorsement" means an indorsement made
		by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An
		anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may
		be negotiated.

### commentary on ## § 3-205. SPECIAL	INDORSEMENT; BLANK INDORSEMENT; ANOMALOUS INDORSEMENT.


(a) A "special indorsement" means the holder of a negotiable instrument (like a check) specifically names a person to whom the instrument is made payable. Once made, the instrument can only be negotiated (transferred for value) by the person named on the indorsement. The rules outlined in Section 3-110 apply to special indorsements. Think of it as a post-it note with a specific name on it, attached to a dollar bill - only the person named can spend that dollar.

(b) A "blank indorsement" is when the holder of an instrument simply signs it without naming a person to whom it's made payable. The instrument becomes payable to whoever holds it and can be negotiated without a specific indorsement. It's like signing a dollar bill - anyone who holds it can spend it.

(c) The holder can turn a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing the name of a person above the signature. It's like turning a signed dollar bill into a specifically named post-it note dollar bill.

(d) An "anomalous indorsement" is when someone who isn't the holder of the instrument makes an indorsement. This doesn't change how the instrument can be negotiated. Imagine someone who isn't the owner of a dollar bill signing it - their signature doesn't impact how the dollar bill can be used. 

This section is essentially a part of a rulebook for financial 'hot potato' - defining who can pass the potato, how they can pass it, and who can ultimately hold it.

Primary tabs







(a) An indorsement limiting
	payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of
	the instrument is not effective to prevent further
	transfer or negotiation of the instrument.
(b) An indorsement stating
	a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect
	the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A
	person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard
	the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected
	by whether the condition has been fulfilled.
(c) If an instrument bears
	an indorsement (i) described in Section 4-201(b),
	or (ii) in blank or to a particular bank using the words "for deposit," "for
	collection," or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument
	collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular
	account, the following rules apply:
(1) A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when
	so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument
	is received by the indorser or applied consistently
	with the indorsement.
(2) A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or
	takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the
	amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or
	applied consistently with the indorsement.
(3) A payor bank that is also the depositary bank
	or that takes the instrument for immediate payment
	over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument
	unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or
	applied consistently with the indorsement.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3),
	a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the indorsement and
	is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are
	not received by the indorser or applied consistently
	with the indorsement.
(d) Except for an indorsement covered
	by subsection (c), if an instrument bears an indorsement
	using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the indorsee as agent,
	trustee, or other fiduciary for the benefit of the indorser or
	another person, the following rules apply:
(1) Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty
	as provided in Section 3-307, a person who purchases the instrument from
	the indorsee or takes the instrument from the indorsee for collection or payment
	may pay the proceeds of payment or the value given for the instrument to the
	indorsee without regard to whether the indorsee violates a fiduciary duty to
	the indorser.
(2) A subsequent transferee of the instrument or
	person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected
	by the restriction in the indorsement unless the
	transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt
	with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.
(e) The presence on an instrument of
	an indorsement to which this section applies does
	not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder
	in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under
	subsection (c) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty
	as stated in subsection (d).
(f) In an action to enforce
	the obligation of a party to pay the instrument,
	the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an indorsement to
	which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.

### commentary on ## § 3-206. RESTRICTIVE	INDORSEMENT.


This section pertains to restrictive endorsements on negotiable instruments (e.g., checks, promissory notes). 

(a) States that an endorsement that limits payment to a specific person or prohibits further transfer doesn't actually prevent further transfer or negotiation of the instrument. 

(b) States that an endorsement which includes a condition for the endorse to receive payment doesn't impact the endorsee's right to enforce the instrument. Parties handling the instrument can ignore this condition. 

(c) Sets out rules for instruments that bear endorsements for deposit or collection by a bank. It specifies that a person, other than a bank, who purchases such an instrument converts the instrument unless payment is made to the endorser or is used in accordance with the endorsement. 

(d) Discusses instruments bearing endorsements indicating payment is to be made to the endorsee acting as an agent, trustee, or fiduciary for the benefit of the endorser or another person. It safeguards purchasers and payors from potential breaches of fiduciary duty by the endorsee, unless they have explicit knowledge of such a breach.

(e) States that the presence of a restrictive endorsement on an instrument does not prevent its purchaser from becoming a "holder in due course" unless they are a converter under sub-section (c) or know about a breach of fiduciary duty as per sub-section (d). 

(f) Allows a party obligated to make payment on the instrument to use a defense in an enforcement action if payment would violate a restrictive endorsement, and if such payment is not permitted by this section. 

In summary, this section permits certain restrictive endorsements on negotiable instruments, but also limits their enforceability and sets out protection for parties handling such instruments.

## § 3-207. REACQUISITION.









Reacquisition of an instrument occurs
	if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or
	otherwise. A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel indorsements made
	after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument. If the cancellation
	causes the instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the reacquirer
	may negotiate the instrument. An indorser whose
	indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is effective against
	any subsequent holder.

PART 3. ENFORCEMENT OF INSTRUMENTS ›







### commentary on ## § 3-207. REACQUISITION.


This section pertains to the reacquisition of a financial instrument. If an instrument is transferred back to a previous holder, this constitutes a reacquisition. The reacquirer is permitted to erase endorsements that were made after they initially held the instrument. If this deletion results in the instrument becoming payable to them or a bearer, the reacquirer is allowed to negotiate the instrument. If an endorser's endorsement has been eliminated, they are released from any obligations, and this release is binding on any future holders of the instrument.

In simpler terms, this section essentially gives an original holder the power to reset the instrument to the state it was in when they first held it, should they acquire it again. They can cancel any endorsements that happened after their initial holding period and if this makes the instrument payable to them or to anyone who holds it, they can trade or sell it. Moreover, anyone who had endorsed it but had their endorsement cancelled is let off the hook and protected against any future holders.

§ 3-302. HOLDER	IN DUE COURSE. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-301. PERSON	ENTITLED TO ENFORCE INSTRUMENT.


This section of law defines who is considered a "person entitled to enforce" an instrument, which can be a document representing a legal obligation such as a contract, will, deed, etc. This can be (i) the holder of the instrument, (ii) a non-holder in possession of the instrument who still maintains the rights of a holder, or (iii) someone not in possession of the instrument but is still entitled to enforce it under Sections 3-309 or 3-418(d). The law states that a person can be entitled to enforce the instrument even if they are not the owner or if they are in wrongful possession of it.

This means that even if you are not the original owner of a contract or legal document but have it in your possession, you may still have the legal right to enforce the terms of that document. Similarly, even if you do not physically possess the document but are entitled to enforce it under specific laws, you can still be considered a person entitled to enforce it. Interestingly, the law also allows for a person to be considered entitled to enforce an instrument even if they are in wrongful possession of it, implying that the legality of possession is secondary to the right to enforce the instrument's terms.

## § 3-302. HOLDER	IN DUE COURSE.


Primary tabs







(a) Subject to subsection
	(c) and Section 3-106(d), "holder
	in due course" means the holder of an instrument if:
(1) the instrument when issued or
	negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or
	is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity;
	and
(2) the holder took the instrument (i)
	for value, (ii) in good faith, (iii) without notice
	that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured
	default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as
	part of the same series, (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an
	unauthorized signature or has been altered, (v) without notice of any claim
	to the instrument described in Section 3-306, and (vi)
	without notice that any party has a defense or claim in
	recoupment described in Section 3-305(a).
(b) Notice of discharge of
	a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding,
	is not notice of a defense under subsection (a), but discharge is effective
	against a person who became a holder in due course with
	notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does
	not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim
	to the instrument.
(c) Except to the extent a
	transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder
	in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course
	of an instrument taken (i) by legal process or by
	purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor's sale or similar proceeding,
	(ii) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business
	of the transferor, or (iii) as the successor in interest to an estate or other
	organization.
(d) If, under Section 3-303(a)(1),
	the promise of performance that is the consideration for
	an instrument has been partially performed, the holder
	may assert rights as a holder in due course of
	the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument
	equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised
	performance.
(e) If (i) the person
		entitled to enforce an instrument has only a
		security interest in the instrument and (ii) the person obliged to pay the
		instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that
		may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person
		entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder
		in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at
		the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the
		unpaid obligation secured.
(f) To be effective, notice
	must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity
	to act on it.
(g) This section is subject
	to any law limiting status as a holder in due course in
	particular classes of transactions.

### commentary on ## § 3-302. HOLDER	IN DUE COURSE.


This legal excerpt outlines the requirements and limitations for a person to be considered a holder in due course of a financial instrument such as a check or note. 

In summary, a holder in due course is someone who has received a financial instrument in good faith, without any suspicion or knowledge of irregularities or potential claims against it. 

(a) This person must have received the instrument without any obvious signs of forgery or alteration and must have taken it for value, in good faith, without any notice of it being overdue, dishonored, or associated with other defaults. They should also be unaware of unauthorized signatures, alterations, or any claims or defenses against the instrument. 

(b) The notice of a party's discharge, unless due to insolvency, doesn't count as a defense, but the discharge is effective if the holder in due course knew about it. Moreover, public filing or recording of a document doesn't constitute notice of a defense or claim against the instrument. 

(c) A person cannot be a holder in due course if they received the instrument through legal processes, bulk transactions outside the ordinary business, or as a successor to an estate or other organization, unless the previous owner had rights as a holder in due course. 

(d) If the agreed performance for an instrument has been partially completed, then the holder in due course can only assert rights equivalent to the value of the partial performance. 

(e) If the person entitled to enforce the instrument only has a security interest and the person required to pay the instrument has a defense or claim that can be asserted against the one who granted the security interest, then the enforcer may only assert rights as a holder in due course up to the unpaid obligation amount. 

(f) For notice to be effective, it must be received in a timely manner that allows reasonable opportunity to act on it.

(g) This section is subject to any laws which may limit holder in due course status for specific types of transactions. 

The two sections following this (3-303 and 3-301) discuss who is entitled to enforce an instrument and what constitutes value and consideration.

## § 3-303. VALUE	AND CONSIDERATION.


Primary tabs







(a) An instrument is issued or
	transferred for value if:
(1) the instrument is issued or
	transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent
	the promise has been performed;
(2) the transferee acquires a security interest or other
	lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained
	by judicial proceeding;
(3) the instrument is issued or
	transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against any
	person, whether or not the claim is due;
(4) the instrument is issued or
	transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument;
	or
(5) the instrument is issued or
	transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation to a
	third party by the person taking the instrument.
(b) "Consideration" means
	any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. The drawer or maker of
	an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without
	consideration. If an instrument is issued for a promise of
	performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance
	of the promise is due and the promise has not been performed. If an instrument
	is issued for value as stated in subsection (a), the instrument is also issued
	for consideration.




‹ § 3-302. HOLDER	IN DUE COURSE.
up
§ 3-304. OVERDUE	INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-303. VALUE	AND CONSIDERATION.


This section details the conditions under which a financial instrument can be considered as being transferred or issued for value. Five conditions are defined, encompassing a wide range of scenarios such as payment for a promise of performance, acquiring a security interest or other lien in the instrument, payment or security for an antecedent claim, in exchange for another negotiable instrument, or in exchange for incurring an irrevocable obligation to a third party.

In addition, this section also defines what is meant by the term "consideration" in the context of financial instruments. Consideration is referred to as any contribution that is enough to support a simple contract. If a financial instrument is issued without consideration, the drawer or maker of the instrument has a defence. Similarly, if the instrument is issued for a promise of performance, the issuer also has a defence if the promise hasn't been performed.

This section essentially provides the foundation for the basic principle of contract law: for a contract to be legally binding, it must involve the exchange of consideration, or something of value. This ensures that all parties involved in the agreement have a stake in its fulfillment.

## § 3-304. OVERDUE	INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) An instrument payable
	on demand becomes overdue at the earliest of the following times:
(1) on the day after the day demand for payment is duly
	made;
(2) if the instrument is a check,
	90 days after its date; or
(3) if the instrument is not
	a check, when the instrument has been outstanding for a
	period of time after its date which is unreasonably long under the circumstances
	of the particular case in light of the nature of the instrument and usage of
	the trade.
(b) With respect to an instrument payable
	at a definite time the following rules apply:
(1) If the principal is payable in installments
	and a due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes
	overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment,
	and the instrument remains overdue until the default is cured.
(2) If the principal is not payable in installments
	and the due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes
	overdue on the day after the due date.
(3) If a due date with respect to principal has
	been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on
	the day after the accelerated due date.
(c) Unless the due date of
	principal has been accelerated, an instrument does
	not become overdue if there is default in payment of interest but no default
	in payment of principal.

### commentary on ## § 3-304. OVERDUE	INSTRUMENT.


This section describes when a financial instrument becomes overdue. 

For an instrument payable on demand, it becomes overdue:
1) The day after a proper demand for payment has been made.
2) If the instrument is a check, 90 days after its date.
3) If the instrument is not a check, when it has been outstanding for an unreasonably long period of time.

For an instrument payable at a definite time:
1) If the principal is payable in installments and a due date has not been accelerated, it becomes overdue upon default for nonpayment of an installment, remaining so until the default is cured.
2) If the principal is not payable in installments and the due date has not been accelerated, it becomes overdue the day after its due date.
3) If a due date with respect to principal has been accelerated, it becomes overdue the day after the accelerated due date.

The instrument does not become overdue if there is a default in payment of interest but no default in payment of principal, unless the due date of the principal has been accelerated. 

In simpler terms, this section explains when a payment becomes officially late - either the day after you're supposed to pay it, the day after you've asked for it to be paid, or after it's been hanging around unpaid for way too long. If you've arranged to pay in parts, it's also late if you miss an installment. However, you're not overdue if you've only missed an interest payment, unless you've asked for the whole amount to be paid sooner.

(a) Except as otherwise provided
	in this section, the right to enforce the obligation of a party to
	pay an instrument is subject to the following:
(1) a defense of the obligor based on (i) infancy of the
	obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple contract, (ii) duress, lack
	of legal capacity, or illegality of the transaction which, under other law,
	nullifies the obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor
	to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor
	reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or
	(iv) discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings;
(2) a defense of the obligor stated in another section
	of this Article or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing
	a right to payment under a simple contract; and
(3) a claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original
	payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the
	transaction that gave rise to the instrument; but the claim of the obligor may
	be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount
	owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.
(b) The right of a holder
		in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to
		pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the
		obligor stated in subsection (a)(1), but is not subject to defenses of the
		obligor stated in subsection (a)(2) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection
		(a)(3) against a person other than the holder.
(c) Except as stated in subsection
	(d), in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to
	pay the instrument, the obligor may not assert against
	the person entitled to enforce the instrument
	a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument (Section 3-306)
	of another person, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted
	by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts
	the claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument. An obligor
	is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the
	instrument does not have rights of a holder in
	due course and the obligor proves that the instrument
	is a lost or stolen instrument.
(d) In an action to enforce
	the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument,
	the accommodation party may assert against the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under
	subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled
	to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings,
	infancy, and lack of legal capacity.
(e) In a consumer
		transaction, if law other than this article requires that an instrument
		include a statement to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee
		are subject to a claim or defense that the issuer could assert against the
		original payee, and the instrument does not include such a statement: (1) the
		instrument has the same effect as if the instrument included such a statement;
		(2) the issuer may assert against the holder or transferee all claims and defenses
		that would have been available if the instrument included such a statement;
		and (3) the extent to which claims may be asserted against the holder or transferee
		is determined as if the instrument included such a statement. 
(f) This section is subject to law
	other than this article that establishes a different rule for consumer
	transactions.

### commentary on ## § 3-305. DEFENSES	AND CLAIMS IN RECOUPMENT.


§ 3-305 of this law discusses the defenses that can be used if a party is obligated to pay an instrument. 

Subsection (a) lists defenses including infancy of the obligor, duress, lack of legal capacity, illegality of the transaction, fraud, and discharge in insolvency proceedings. 

Subsection (b) adds that a holder in due course can also enforce the obligation, subject to the defenses stated in subsection (a)(1), but not those in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 

Subsection (c) prohibits the obligor from asserting a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument of another person unless that person is joined in the action and personally asserts the claim.

Subsection (d) states that an accommodation party, in an action to enforce the obligation, can assert any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert, except for the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal capacity. 

Subsection (e) relates to consumer transactions. If other law requires that an instrument include a statement that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to a claim or defense, and the instrument does not include such a statement, the instrument is treated as if it did include such a statement. 

Finally, subsection (f) states that this section is subject to other laws that establish different rules for consumer transactions. 

In short, this section outlines the various defenses and claims that can be made in the enforcement of an obligation to pay an instrument, depending on the status of the obligor, the holder in due course, and, where relevant, the accommodation party and consumer transactions.

### commentary on ## § 3-306. CLAIMS	TO AN INSTRUMENT.


This section outlines the rights and responsibilities of someone who takes possession of a financial instrument (like a check or a money order) that they do not rightfully own. If someone is not a holder in due course – meaning they obtained the instrument legitimately and without knowledge of any issues – they may be subject to claims of property or possession rights. This includes the right to reverse the transaction and recover the instrument or its proceeds.

However, if someone is a holder in due course – meaning they took the instrument in good faith, without knowledge of any problems, and for value – they are not subject to these claims. This means they can keep the instrument even if the original owner claims it was lost, stolen, or forged.

So if you unknowingly accept a stolen check, and you're not a holder in due course, you might have to return the check or its proceeds. But if you're a holder in due course, you're protected from these claims.

This law is important because it protects innocent parties who accept payment in good faith. It also provides a legal recourse for people who had their instruments wrongfully taken.

In simple terms: "If you innocently and legitimately get hold of a financial document, you're clear. If not, you may have to deal with the original owner's claims. But if you knowingly deal in dodgy documents, you'll get into trouble."

(a) In this section:
(1) "Fiduciary" means
	an agent, trustee, partner, corporate officer or director, or other representative
	owing a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument.
(2) "Represented

	has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (iii) the represented
	person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the
	transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the following rules

### commentary on ## § 3-307. NOTICE	OF BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY.


This section of the law, § 3-307, discusses the notice of breach of fiduciary duty. 

In summary, a fiduciary is defined as any person who has a duty of trust, such as an agent, trustee, partner, or corporate officer. The person or entity to whom this duty is owed is referred to as the "represented person."

The law stipulates that if an instrument (a document promising payment) is taken from a fiduciary with the knowledge of their fiduciary status, and the represented person makes a claim to the instrument due to a breach of fiduciary duty, several rules apply:

1. The notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary counts as notice of the represented person's claim.
2. If the instrument is payable to the represented person or the fiduciary, the taker has notice of the breach if the instrument was taken in payment of a known personal debt of the fiduciary, for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or was deposited into an unrelated account.
3. If the represented person or fiduciary issues the instrument made payable to the fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach unless they know of it.
4. If the represented person or fiduciary issues the instrument to the taker as payee, the taker has notice of the breach if the instrument was taken in similar circumstances as in rule 2.

In layman's terms, this law discusses how the knowledge and actions of a third party (the "taker") can affect a claim of breach of fiduciary duty between a fiduciary and the person they represent. The third party must be aware of certain conditions related to the fiduciary's personal interests or debts to be considered as having notice of the breach.

Primary tabs







(a) In an action with respect
	to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority
	to make, each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied
	in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings,
	the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but
	the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is
	to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent
	at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If
	an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed
	principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to
	the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant
	is liable on the instrument as a represented person under
	Section 3-402(a).
(b) If the validity of signatures
	is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection
	(a), a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled
	to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under
	Section 3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or
	claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the
	right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except
	to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder
	in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.

### commentary on ## § 3-308. PROOF	OF SIGNATURES AND STATUS AS HOLDER IN DUE COURSE.


This section establishes the rules and procedures for proving the authenticity of signatures on a financial instrument and the status of a holder in due course in a legal action. 

(a) Essentially, signatures on a financial instrument are assumed authentic and authorized unless specifically contested in legal proceedings. If a signature's validity is disputed, the burden of proof lies with the person claiming the signature's authenticity. Exemptions to this rule include cases where the signatory is deceased or incapable at the time of trial. When a legal action is brought against an undisclosed principal, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant is liable under Section 3-402(a). 

(b) Once the validity of signatures is admitted or proven and the rules of subsection (a) are obeyed, a plaintiff with the instrument is entitled to payment if they can demonstrate their right to enforce the instrument under Section 3-301. If a defense or claim in recoupment is established by the defendant, the plaintiff's right to payment is subject to this defense or claim, unless the plaintiff can prove they have the rights of a holder in due course that are not subject to the defense or claim.

In simpler terms, this section means that when you sign a check or other financial document, your signature is assumed to be authentic unless someone challenges it in court. If challenged, the person who presented the document must prove that your signature is genuine. However, if you're dead or incapable, your signature is automatically presumed genuine. The rules change somewhat when the case involves a hidden or 'undisclosed' principal. When someone sues for payment, they're generally entitled to it unless the person being sued can prove a valid defense or counterclaim. But even then, a plaintiff who can prove they hold the document in good faith (a holder in due course) can still claim payment, despite the defense or counterclaim.

(a) A person not in possession
	of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument
	if: 
(1) the person seeking to enforce the instrument
(A) was entitled to enforce it the instrument when loss
	of possession occurred, or
(B) has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the
	instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss
	of possession occurred; 
(2) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer

(3) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of
	the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot
	be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a
	person that cannot	be found or is not amenable to service of process. 
(b) A person seeking enforcement
	of an instrument under subsection (a) must prove the
	terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If
	that proof is made, Section 3-308 applies to the case
	as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The
	court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless
	it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected
	against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce
	the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable
	means.

§ 3-310. EFFECT	OF INSTRUMENT ON OBLIGATION FOR WHICH TAKEN. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-309. ENFORCEMENT	OF LOST, DESTROYED, OR STOLEN INSTRUMENT.


This section of the law provides a way for a person to enforce an instrument, even if they do not physically possess it because it has been lost, destroyed, or stolen. They must, however, have had the right to enforce it when it was lost, and the loss must not have been due to a transfer or lawful seizure. The person also must be unable to reasonably get the instrument back due to it being destroyed, its whereabouts unknown, or it being wrongfully possessed by an unreachable person.

To enforce the instrument, the person must prove both the terms of the instrument and their right to enforce it. If they can do this, the court treats the case as if the person had physically produced the instrument. However, the court must be satisfied that the person who is supposed to pay the instrument is protected against potential loss if another person makes a claim to enforce the instrument. This protection can be provided through any reasonable means.

This section is sandwiched between § 3-308 which discusses proof of signatures and holder status, and § 3-310 which deals with the effect of an instrument on the obligation for which it was taken.

In simpler terms, if you've lost a check (or it was stolen or destroyed), but you were legally entitled to cash it when it went missing, you can still enforce the check. You'll need to prove your rights and the check's terms, and ensure that the payer won't be out of pocket if someone else also tries to cash it.

Primary tabs







(a) Unless otherwise agreed,
	if a certified check, cashier's
	check, or teller's check is taken for an obligation,
	the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an
	amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were
	taken in payment of the obligation. Discharge of the obligation does not
	affect any liability that the obligor may have as an indorser of
	the instrument.
(b) Unless otherwise agreed
	and except as provided in subsection (a), if a note or an
	uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation
	is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount
	of money equal to the amount of the instrument were
	taken, and the following rules apply:
(1) In the case of an uncertified check,
	suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until
	it is paid or certified. Payment or certification of the check results
	in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the amount of the check.
(2) In the case of a note, suspension
	of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid. Payment
	of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4), if the check or note is
	dishonored and the obligee of the obligation for which the instrument was
	taken is the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument, the obligee may enforce either the instrument or the obligation. In
	the case of an instrument of a third person which is negotiated to the obligee
	by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the
	obligation.
(4) If the person
		entitled to enforce the instrument taken for
		an obligation is a person other than the obligee, the obligee may not enforce
		the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended. If the obligee
		is the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession
		of it because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, the obligation may not be
		enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to that
		extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement
		of the instrument.
(c) If an instrument other
	than one described in subsection (a) or (b) is taken for an obligation, the
	effect is (i) that stated in subsection (a) if the instrument is one on which
	a bank is liable as maker or acceptor,
	or (ii) that stated in subsection (b) in any other case.

### commentary on ## § 3-310. EFFECT	OF INSTRUMENT ON OBLIGATION FOR WHICH TAKEN.


This section of the law discusses the impact of various types of financial instruments (like certified checks, cashier's checks, notes, or uncertified checks) on an existing financial obligation.

Subsection (a) explains that if a certified check, cashier's check, or teller's check is used to fulfill an obligation, that obligation is considered discharged, as if the debtor had paid in cash. However, the debtor may still have liability as an endorser of the instrument.

Subsection (b) outlines the rules if a note or an uncertified check is used. In this case, the obligation is suspended, not discharged, until the note or check is paid or dishonored. If the obligee (the person to whom the obligation is owed) is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, they can choose to enforce either the instrument or the obligation. However, if the obligee is not the person entitled to enforce the instrument, they cannot enforce the obligation while it is suspended.

Subsection (c) covers other types of instruments not mentioned in (a) or (b), specifying that the effect is as stated in (a) if a bank is liable for the instrument, and as stated in (b) in all other cases.

(a) If a person against whom
	a claim is asserted proves that (i) that person in good
	faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as
	full satisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was unliquidated

	the instrument, the following subsections apply.
(b) Unless subsection (c)
	applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that
	the instrument or an accompanying written communication
	contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered
	as full satisfaction of the claim.
(c) Subject to subsection
	(d), a claim is not discharged under subsection (b) if either of the following
	applies:
(1) The claimant, if an organization, proves that
	(i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous
	statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications
	concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered
	as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office,
	or place, and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received
	by that designated person, office, or place.
(2) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that
	within 90 days after payment of the instrument, the
	claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against
	whom the claim is asserted. This paragraph does not apply if the claimant
	is an organization that that sent a statement complying with paragraph (1)(i).
(d) A claim is discharged if the
	person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time
	before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent
	of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation,
	knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.

§ 3-301. PERSON	ENTITLED TO ENFORCE INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-311. ACCORD	AND SATISFACTION BY USE OF INSTRUMENT.


This legal provision is about 'accord and satisfaction' using an instrument (usually a check or promissory note), a legal concept that refers to the settling of a disputed claim by offering a payment that the claimant accepts as full settlement.

To simplify:

- Subsection (a) sets out the conditions under which a claim can be discharged: the payer has to offer the payment in good faith, the claim amount has to be unliquidated or disputed, and the claimant has to accept and cash the instrument.

- Subsection (b) states that a claim is discharged (i.e., settled) if the payer can prove that the instrument or accompanying letter clearly said that it was meant to be full payment for the claim.

- Subsection (c) provides two exceptions to the rule in subsection (b). One is if the claimant is an organization that had previously instructed the payer to send such instruments to a specific place or person, and the payer didn't. The other is if the claimant, within 90 days after accepting the payment, offers to return it.

- Subsection (d) states that a claim is discharged if the payer can prove that before the payment was collected, the claimant or their agent knew the instrument was meant to be a full settlement of the claim.

This law could come into play in a situation where someone owes another person or business money, and they send a check with a note saying "cashing this check is acceptance of it as full payment of the claim." If the other party cashes the check, they typically can't later sue for more money. But there are exceptions, like if they'd previously instructed the payer to send such checks to a specific place, or if they quickly try to return the payment. 

It's like saying, "I'll give you this $50, and if you accept it, we're square. But if you've told me to send it to your lawyer and I forget, or you try to give it back to me within three months, we may not actually be square."

(a) In this section:
(1) "Check" means
	a cashier's check, teller's
	check, or certified check.
(2) "Claimant" means
	a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's
	check, teller's check, or certified
	check that was lost, destroyed, or stolen.
(3) "Declaration of loss" means
	a statement, made in a record under penalty of perjury, to the effect
	that (i) the declarer lost possession of a check, (ii) the declarer is the drawer or
	payee of the check, in the case of a certified	check,
	or the remitter or payee of the check, in the case of a cashier's
	check or teller's check, (iii) the loss of possession
	was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure, and (iv)
	the declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check
	was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful
	possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable
	to service of process.
(4) "Obligated bank" means
	the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's
	check or the acceptor of a certified check.
(b) A claimant may assert
	a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing
	the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of
	the check, if (i) the claimant is the drawer or payee
	of a certified check or the remitter or
	payee of a cashier's check or teller's
	check, (ii) the communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration
	of loss of the claimant with respect to the check, (iii) the communication is
	received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act
	on it before the check is paid, and (iv) the claimant provides reasonable identification
	if requested by the obligated bank. Delivery of a declaration of loss
	is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration. If
	a claim is asserted in compliance with this subsection, the following rules
	apply:
(1) The claim becomes enforceable at the later of
	(i) the time the claim is asserted, or (ii) the 90th day following the date
	of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's
	check, or the 90th day following the date of the acceptance,
	in the case of a certified check.
(2) Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has
	no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check or, in the case of
	a teller's check, may permit the drawee to
	pay the check. Payment to a person
	entitled to enforce the check discharges all liability of the obligated
	bank with respect to the check.
(3) If the claim becomes enforceable before the
	check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the
	check.
(4) When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated
	bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the check to the claimant if payment
	of the check has not been made to a person
	entitled to enforce the check. Subject to Section 4-302(a)(1),
	payment to the claimant discharges all liability of the obligated bank with
	respect to the check.
(c) If the obligated
		bank pays the amount of a check to a claimant under subsection (b)(4) and
		the check is presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder
		in due course, the claimant is obliged to (i) refund the payment to the
		obligated bank if the check is paid, or (ii) pay the amount of the check to
		the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is dishonored.
(d) If a claimant has the
	right to assert a claim under subsection (b) and is also a person
	entitled to enforce a cashier's check, teller's
	check, or certified check which is lost, destroyed,
	or stolen, the claimant may assert rights with respect to the check either under
	this section or Section 3-309.

### commentary on ## &sect; 3-312. LOST,	DESTROYED, OR STOLEN CASHIER'S CHECK, TELLER'S CHECK, OR CERTIFIED CHECK.


This section outlines the process through which a person can claim the value of a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check that has been lost, destroyed or stolen. This claimant must communicate their claim to the obligated bank with reasonable certainty and must provide a declaration of loss under penalty of perjury. The claim becomes enforceable either at the time it is made or the 90th day following the date of the check or the acceptance of a certified check, whichever is later. If the claim becomes enforceable before the check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the check. The claimant must refund the payment to the obligated bank if the check is paid to someone else, and must pay the holder in due course if the check is dishonored. The claimant also has the right to assert their claim under this section or Section 3-309 if they are also entitled to enforce the lost, destroyed or stolen check.

In simpler terms, this is like a roadmap for what to do if your cashier's check, teller's check or certified check goes missing or gets destroyed. You can make a claim to the bank that issued it, but there are some rules you have to follow, like making a sworn statement that the check was lost and not transferred or seized. The bank can then decide whether to pay out the check or not, but you might have to refund the money if the check pops up and someone else cashes it.

‹ PART 4. LIABILITY OF PARTIES
up
§ 3-402. SIGNATURE	BY REPRESENTATIVE. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-401. SIGNATURE.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code speaks on the liability of a person regarding a signed instrument, which could be a document like a check or promissory note. 

Subsection (a) states that a person can only be held accountable for an instrument if they themselves signed it or if it was signed by a representative or agent acting on their behalf. The validity of the representative’s signature is addressed in Section 3-402.

Subsection (b) details how a signature can be made, allowing for both manual and non-manual methods, potentially including electronic signatures or stamped signatures. It also specifies that a person can use any name, including a business name or pseudonym, or use a mark or symbol, as long as it is used with the intent of authenticating a document. 

This section is important in cases where the liability for a signed document is being contested, and it could also apply in the context of electronic signatures and digital contracts. It does not explicitly discuss these modern contexts, but its language is broad enough to potentially include them. Thus, it provides essential information on the requirements for a valid and binding signature.

(a) If a person acting, or
	purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by
	signing either the name of the represented person or
	the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to
	the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were
	on a simple contract. If the represented person is bound, the signature
	of the representative is the "authorized signature of the represented person" and
	the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified
	in the instrument.
(b) If a representative signs
	the name of the representative to an instrument and
	the signature is an authorized signature of the represented
	person, the following rules apply:
(1) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously
	that the signature is made on behalf of the represented
	person who is identified in the instrument, the
	representative is not liable on the instrument.
(2) Subject to subsection (c), if (i) the form of
	the signature does not show unambiguously that the signature is made in a representative
	capacity or (ii) the represented person is
	not identified in the instrument, the representative
	is liable on the instrument to a holder in due
	course that took the instrument without notice that the representative was
	not intended to be liable on the instrument. With respect to any other
	person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that
	the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.
(c) If a representative signs
	the name of the representative as drawer of a check without
	indication of the representative status and the check is payable from an account
	of the represented person who is identified
	on the check, the signer is not liable on the check if the signature is an authorized
	signature of the represented person.




‹ § 3-401. SIGNATURE.
up
§ 3-403. UNAUTHORIZED	SIGNATURE. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-402. SIGNATURE	BY REPRESENTATIVE.


This section outlines the legal implications of signatures made by a representative on behalf of another person. 

Subsection (a) states that if a representative signs an instrument under the name of the person they represent, or their own name, the represented person is legally bound by the signature as if they had signed it themselves. This binding effect applies regardless of whether the represented person is identified in the instrument.

Subsection (b) elaborates on the liability of the representative if they sign the instrument under their own name. If it is clear from the signature form that the signature was made on behalf of the represented person, the representative is not liable. However, if it is not clear from the signature form that the signature was made in a representative capacity or if the represented person is not identified, the representative may be held liable, unless the representative can prove that the original parties did not intend for the representative to be liable.

Subsection (c) covers the scenario where a representative signs a check under their own name without indicating their representative status. If the check is payable from the account of the represented person, the signer is not held liable.

This can be seen as a legal defense for agents acting on behalf of their principals, providing they make it clear in their signature that they are acting in a representative capacity. It also serves as a warning for those acting in a representative capacity to ensure they make their role and responsibilities clear when signing documents to avoid personal liability.

(b) If the signature of more
	than one person is required to constitute the authorized signature of an organization,

§ 3-404. IMPOSTORS;	FICTITIOUS PAYEES. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-403. UNAUTHORIZED	SIGNATURE.


This article, § 3-403, refers to the circumstances and consequences surrounding unauthorized signatures in contractual matters:

(a) Normally, an unauthorized signature is not legally valid unless stated otherwise in this or another related Article. However, it may be considered valid if the recipient of the instrument was not aware of the forgery and acted in good faith. The unauthorized signature can also be ratified, or approved, which would then make it legally effective for the purposes of this Article.

(b) In cases where the signature of more than one person is essential for an organization, the absence of one of the required signatures leads to the whole signature being considered unauthorized.

(c) Regardless of any other clauses in this Article that might make an unauthorized signature legally effective, the person who signed without authorization can still be held civilly or crimically liable.

In simpler terms, this law is about the rules around unauthorized signatures. If someone signs something without the proper authority, that signature is generally not considered valid, unless it's been accepted by someone acting in good faith or officially ratified. For organizations that need multiple signatures, missing one makes the entire thing unauthorized. And even if the law somehow makes the unauthorized signature valid, the person who signed can still be held responsible.

(a) If an impostor, by use
	of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the
	instrument to the impostor, or to a person acting in concert with the impostor,
	by impersonating the payee of the instrument or a person authorized to act for
	the payee, an indorsement of the instrument by any
	person in the name of the payee is effective as the indorsement of the payee
	in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument
	or takes it for value or for collection.
(b) If (i) a person whose
	intent determines to whom an instrument is payable
	(Section 3-110(a) or (b)) does not intend the person
	identified as payee to have any interest in the instrument, or (ii) the person
	identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, the following rules

(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is
	its holder.
(2) An indorsement by
	any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is
	effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good
	faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.
(c) Under subsection (a) or
	(b), an indorsement is made in the name of a payee
	if (i) it is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee or (ii)
	the instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited
	in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of
	the payee.
(d) With respect to an instrument to
	which subsection (a) or (b) applies, if a person paying the instrument or taking
	it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary
	care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes
	to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss
	may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent
	the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.

### commentary on ## § 3-404. IMPOSTORS;	FICTITIOUS PAYEES.


This section of law deals with the issue of fraud related to negotiable instruments, such as checks or promissory notes, where the payee is either an impostor or a fictitious person. It provides that if the issuer of the instrument is induced by a fraudster to issue an instrument to them, or someone acting in collusion with them, any endorsement of the instrument in the name of the payee will be considered valid in favor of anyone who pays the instrument or takes it for value or collection in good faith. 

The same principle applies if the person intending to determine the payee does not intend the person identified as the payee to have any interest in the instrument, or if the payee is fictitious. In such cases, any person in possession of the instrument is its holder and any endorsement in the name of the payee is considered valid in favor of a person who pays the instrument or takes it for value or collection in good faith.

Furthermore, an endorsement is considered to be made in the name of a payee if it is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee, or if the instrument is deposited in a bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee.

Finally, the law provides that if a person fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and this failure significantly contributes to a loss resulting from the payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care up to the extent that the failure to exercise such care contributed to the loss. In simple terms, if a person or institution is careless in dealing with a fraudulent instrument, they may be held partially responsible for any resulting loss. 

This section does not appear to have comparable counterparts in all jurisdictions and is not always interpreted in the same way. It is best to consult an attorney or legal expert to understand the precise implications of this law in a specific situation.

## § 3-405. EMPLOYER’S	RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRAUDULENT INDORSEMENT BY EMPLOYEE.


Primary tabs







(a) In this section:
(1) "Employee" includes
	an independent contractor and employee of an independent contractor retained
	by the employer.
(2) "Fraudulent
		indorsement" means (i) in the case of an instrument payable
		to the employer, a forged indorsement purporting
		to be that of the employer, or (ii) in the case of an instrument with respect
		to which the employer is the issuer, a forged indorsement
		purporting to be that of the person identified as payee.
(3) "Responsibility" with
	respect to instruments means authority (i) to sign
	or indorse instruments on behalf of the employer, (ii) to process instruments
	received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for deposit to an account,
	or for other disposition, (iii) to prepare or process instruments for issue in
	the name of the employer, (iv) to supply information determining the names or
	addresses of payees of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer,
	(v) to control the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of the
	employer, or (vi) to act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible
	capacity. "Responsibility" does not include authority that merely
	allows an employee to have access to instruments or blank or incomplete
	instrument forms that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming
	or outgoing mail, or similar access.
(b) For the purpose of determining
	the rights and liabilities of a person who, in good faith,
	pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection,
	if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the
	instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee
	makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument,
	the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of
	the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that
	person. If the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or
	for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in
	paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to
	loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from
	the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise
	ordinary care contributed to the loss.
(c) Under subsection (b),
	an indorsement is made in the name of the person
	to whom an instrument is payable if (i) it is made
	in a name substantially similar to the name of that person or (ii) the instrument,
	whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in
	a name substantially similar to the name of that person.

### commentary on ## § 3-405. EMPLOYER’S	RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRAUDULENT INDORSEMENT BY EMPLOYEE.


This section deals with the responsibility of an employer in cases where an employee has fraudulently endorsed an instrument. 

In layman's term, it means the following. Imagine running a small business and one of your employees is involved in a fraudulent activity. They forge your signature on a check. This is a fraudulent endorsement. Now, how responsible are you, as the employer, for this fraudulent act by your employee?

According to this section, if you had entrusted the employee with the responsibility related to the handling of such instruments, then in the eyes of the law, the endorsement is considered valid. So, if someone accepts the check in good faith and suffers a loss because of the fraud, they can hold you responsible for the loss. 

However, the person accepting the check also has a duty of care. If they didn't exercise ordinary care (for example, they didn't verify the signature properly) and this contributed to their loss, then their ability to recover the loss from you may be reduced.

The section also clarifies a few definitions. For example, an employee can include an independent contractor, and 'responsibility' does not merely mean access to the instruments.

## § 3-406. NEGLIGENCE	CONTRIBUTING TO FORGED SIGNATURE OR ALTERATION OF INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) A person whose failure
	to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes
	to an alteration of an instrument or
	to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting
	the alteration or the forgery against a person who, in good
	faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.
(b) Under subsection (a),
	if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary
	care in paying or taking the instrument and that
	failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the
	person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent
	to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.
(c) Under subsection (a),
	the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is
	on the person asserting the preclusion. Under subsection (b), the burden
	of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person precluded.

### commentary on ## § 3-406. NEGLIGENCE	CONTRIBUTING TO FORGED SIGNATURE OR ALTERATION OF INSTRUMENT.


This section of the law is about negligence that has substantially contributed to forged signatures or alterations on a legal financial instrument (like a check or a promissory note). 

In a nutshell, this law says that if someone didn't take the proper care and this failure significantly contributed to the forgery or alteration of the instrument, they cannot blame or sue another party who, in good faith, paid the instrument or took it for value or collection. 

But there's a caveat. If the person who is claiming this legal protection (preclusion) also didn't take proper care and this negligence caused some loss, then the loss will be shared between both parties. The allocation of the loss would be based on how much each party's lack of care contributed to the loss. 

The burden of proof falls on the person asserting the preclusion to prove that the other party didn't exercise ordinary care. If losses have to be allocated, the person who is being precluded from making a claim will have to prove that the person asserting the preclusion also didn't take proper care.

So this law is a sort of a safeguard for people who unknowingly deal with a forged or altered instrument, but it also expects all parties to exercise proper care to prevent such instances.

## § 3-407. ALTERATION.









(a) "Alteration" means
	(i) an unauthorized change in an instrument that purports
	to modify in any respect the obligation of a party, or
	(ii) an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete
	instrument relating to the obligation of a party.
(b) Except as provided in
	subsection (c), an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose
	obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded
	from asserting the alteration. No other alteration
	discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced
	according to its original terms.
(c) A payor bank or drawee paying
	a fraudulently altered instrument or a person taking
	it for value, in good faith and without notice of the
	alteration, may enforce rights with respect to the instrument (i) according
	to its original terms, or (ii) in the case of an incomplete
	instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as
	completed.

up
§ 3-408. DRAWEE	NOT LIABLE ON UNACCEPTED DRAFT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-407. ALTERATION.


This clause defines what constitutes an "alteration" of an instrument such as a check or promissory note. It categorizes alteration as either an unauthorized change that modifies a party's obligation or an unauthorized addition or change to an incomplete instrument related to a party's obligation.

The clause also outlines the consequences of an alteration. If an alteration is made fraudulently, it discharges the party whose obligation is changed by the alteration unless they agreed to the change or cannot assert the alteration for some reason. The only exception to this rule is for a payor bank or drawee who pays an altered instrument or a person who takes it for value, in good faith, without knowledge of the alteration. They may enforce rights according to the original terms of the instrument or, in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its completed terms.

In simple terms, if someone changes the information on a check without permission and tries to cash it, the party who originally wrote the check isn't responsible for the altered amount unless they knowingly agreed to the change or for some reason can't challenge the alteration. However, if a bank unknowingly cashes an altered check, they have the right to enforce the original terms of the check or, if it was incomplete when altered, the terms as completed.

## § 3-408. DRAWEE	NOT LIABLE ON UNACCEPTED DRAFT.


Primary tabs







A check or other draft does
	not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the drawee available
	for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until
	the drawee accepts it.




‹ § 3-407. ALTERATION.
up
§ 3-409. ACCEPTANCE	OF DRAFT; CERTIFIED CHECK. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-408. DRAWEE	NOT LIABLE ON UNACCEPTED DRAFT.


This section clarifies the liability of the drawee (the entity who is expected to pay the check or draft) in the case of an unaccepted check or draft. According to this, a check or a draft doesn't automatically assign funds in the drawee's possession for its payment. Also, the drawee isn't liable for the instrument unless they accept it.

Analogy: Think of the drawee as a hotel guest who has been presented with a bill. The mere presentation of the bill does not mean that the guest's money (funds) is automatically allotted to pay that bill. Also, the guest isn't liable to pay the bill unless they accept it.

Commonly referred counterparts: This rule is a commonly referred counterpart in situations involving bounced checks or drafts, where the drawee's acceptance hasn't been secured. 

Significant timeline events: This section becomes significantly applicable when the drawee's acceptance is in question, raising issues of liability and fund allocation.

## § 3-409. ACCEPTANCE	OF DRAFT; CERTIFIED CHECK.


Primary tabs







(a) "Acceptance" means
	the drawee's signed agreement to pay a draft as
	presented. It must be written on the draft and may consist of the drawee's
	signature alone. Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective
	when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is
	delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.
(b) A draft may
	be accepted although it has not been signed by the drawer,
	is otherwise incomplete, is overdue, or has been dishonored.
(c) If a draft is
	payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails
	to date the acceptance, the holder may complete the acceptance by supplying
	a date in good faith.
(d) "Certified
		check" means a check accepted by the bank
		on which it is drawn. Acceptance may be made as stated in subsection
		(a) or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified. The drawee of
		a check has no obligation to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not
		dishonor of the check.

§ 3-410. ACCEPTANCE	VARYING DRAFT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-409. ACCEPTANCE	OF DRAFT; CERTIFIED CHECK.


In layman's terms, this section discusses the concept of "acceptance" in the context of drafts and certified checks. 

(a) "Acceptance" is when a drawee (the person or entity that the check is drawn on) agrees to pay a draft (order to pay a specific sum). This agreement to pay must be written on the draft, which can be just the signature of the drawee. This acceptance can be made at any point and becomes valid when the drawee notifies the person who initiated the draft or when the accepted draft is given to someone for the purpose of establishing rights on the acceptance.

(b) A draft can still be accepted even if it lacks the signature of the drawer (the person who writes the check), is incomplete, overdue, or has been dishonoured.

(c) If a draft is set to be payable at a specific time period after it has been seen and the acceptor forgets to date the acceptance, the holder of the draft can complete the acceptance by providing a date in good faith.

(d) A "certified check" is a check that has been accepted by the bank it is drawn on. The acceptance can be done in the way stated in subsection (a) or by a written indication on the check that it is certified. The drawee of a check is not obliged to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not considered as dishonoring the check.

In sum, this section clarifies how acceptance works in the context of drafts and checks, and also explains what a certified check means. It provides important guidelines for the parties involved in a transaction using drafts or checks.

## § 3-410. ACCEPTANCE	VARYING DRAFT.


Primary tabs







(a) If the terms of a drawee's acceptance vary
	from the terms of the draft as presented, the holder may
	refuse the acceptance and treat the draft as dishonored. In that case,
	the drawee may cancel the acceptance.
(b) The terms of a draft are
	not varied by an acceptance to pay at a particular
	bank or place in the United States, unless the acceptance states that the draft
	is to be paid only at that bank or place.
(c) If the holder assents
	to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft,
	the obligation of each drawer and indorser that
	does not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged.

§ 3-411. REFUSAL	TO PAY CASHIER'S CHECKS, TELLER'S CHECKS, AND CERTIFIED CHECKS. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-410. ACCEPTANCE	VARYING DRAFT.


This section outlines the procedures and rights concerning a drawee's acceptance of a draft that does not match the original terms. 

Subsection (a) makes it clear that if a drawee's acceptance significantly varies from the original draft, the holder of the draft can refuse the acceptance and treat it as dishonored. It also gives the drawee the right to cancel the acceptance.

Subsection (b) explains that the terms of a draft aren't considered varied if the acceptance commits to payment at a specific bank or location within the US, unless the acceptance specifically states that the draft can only be paid at that location.

Subsection (c) stipulates that if the holder of a draft accepts an amendment to the draft's terms, any drawer or indorser who hasn't explicitly agreed to the acceptance is released from their obligations.

In simpler terms, this section is essentially saying that if a draft is accepted with changes, the holder has the right to reject this acceptance and still consider the draft as unpaid. The only exception is when the acceptance simply specifies a specific payment location, unless it adds that this is the only accepted payment location. Finally, if the holder agrees to the revised acceptance, those who didn't specifically agree to the changes are no longer bound by the draft.

## § 3-411. REFUSAL	TO PAY CASHIER'S CHECKS, TELLER'S CHECKS, AND CERTIFIED CHECKS.


Primary tabs







(a) In this section, "obligated bank" means the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check bought from the issuer.(b) If the obligated bank wrongfully (i) refuses to pay a cashier's check or certified check, (ii) stops payment of a teller's check, or (iii) refuses to pay a dishonored teller's check, the person asserting the right to enforce the check is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the nonpayment and may recover consequential damages if the obligated bank refuses to pay after receiving notice of particular circumstances giving rise to the damages.(c) Expenses or consequential damages under subsection (b) are not recoverable if the refusal of the obligated bank to pay occurs because (i) the bank suspends payments, (ii) the obligated bank asserts a claim or defense of the bank that it has reasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, (iii) the obligated bank has a reasonable doubt whether the person demanding payment is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, or (iv) payment is prohibited by law.

§ 3-412. OBLIGATION	OF ISSUER OF NOTE OR CASHIER’S CHECK. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-411. REFUSAL	TO PAY CASHIER'S CHECKS, TELLER'S CHECKS, AND CERTIFIED CHECKS.


This section discusses the legal responsibilities of the "obligated bank," which is defined as the bank that has accepted a certified check or issued a cashier's or teller's check. It states that if the bank wrongfully refuses to pay these checks or stops payment on a teller's check, the person who holds the check has a right to compensation for any expenses or lost interest caused by the non-payment. The holder of the check may also be entitled to additional damages if the bank still refuses to pay after being notified of specific circumstances that have led to these damages.

However, the holder of the check cannot recover any expenses or damages if the bank's refusal to pay is due to one of several listed reasons. These include a suspension of bank payments, a claim or defense that the bank reasonably believes it has against the holder of the check, reasonable doubt about the identity of the person demanding payment, or a legal prohibition against payment. 

This section thus serves to balance the rights and interests of both the person holding the check and the obligated bank. It discourages wrongful refusal of payment by banks while also acknowledging situations under which banks might be justified in refusing payment.

		terms at the time it was issued or, if not issued, at
		the time it first came into possession of a holder, or (ii) if the issuer signed
		an incomplete instrument, according to
		its terms when completed, to the extent stated in Sections 3-115 and 3-407. The
		obligation is owed to a person entitled
		to enforce the instrument or to an indorser who
		paid the instrument under Section 3-415.




‹ § 3-411. REFUSAL	TO PAY CASHIER'S CHECKS, TELLER'S CHECKS, AND CERTIFIED CHECKS.
up
§ 3-413. OBLIGATION	OF ACCEPTOR. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-412. OBLIGATION	OF ISSUER OF NOTE OR CASHIER’S CHECK.


The section essentially states that the issuer of a note or cashier’s check is legally obligated to pay according to the terms specified at the time of the instrument's issuance, or if it was not issued, when it first came into the possession of a holder. If the instrument was incomplete when signed by the issuer, the obligation to pay still stands, but according to the terms when it was completed. 

This obligation is owed to the person who has the right to enforce the instrument (typically the holder or depositor), or an indorser (someone who has endorsed or signed the instrument, usually on the back) who has already paid the instrument under Section 3-415. 

Analogously, it's like buying a prepaid gift card from a store. The store, as the issuer of the card or 'instrument', is obligated to honor the value of the card when presented for payment by the holder of the card, as specified at the time of the card's purchase or activation. 

A significant timeline event for this section would be when the instrument is first issued or comes into possession of a holder. This is the point at which the issuer’s obligation to pay according to its terms is established. 

A commonly referred counterpart to the issuer in this context could be a bank or financial institution, as they frequently issue notes or cashier’s checks. The counterpart to the person entitled to enforce the instrument would be the holder of the note or check, while the counterpart to the indorser would be an individual or entity who has endorsed the check for payment.

## § 3-413. OBLIGATION	OF ACCEPTOR.


Primary tabs







(a) The acceptor of
	a draft is obliged to pay the draft (i) according to its
	terms at the time it was accepted, even though the acceptance states
	that the draft is payable "as originally drawn" or equivalent terms,
	(ii) if the acceptance varies the terms of the draft, according to the terms
	of the draft as varied, or (iii) if the acceptance is of a draft that
	is an incomplete instrument, according to
	its terms when completed, to the extent stated in Sections 3-115 and 3-407. The
	obligation is owed to a person entitled to
	enforce the draft or to the drawer or an indorser
	who paid the draft under Section 3-414 or 3-415.
(b) If the certification of
	a check or other acceptance of
	a draft states the amount certified or accepted, the obligation
	of the acceptor is that amount. If (i) the certification
	or acceptance does not state an amount, (ii) the amount of the instrument is
	subsequently raised, and (iii) the instrument is then negotiated to a holder
	in due course, the obligation of the acceptor is
	the amount of the instrument at the time it was taken by the holder in due course.

§ 3-414. OBLIGATION	OF DRAWER. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-413. OBLIGATION	OF ACCEPTOR.


The acceptor of a draft (a written order by one party to another to pay a certain sum) is obliged to pay according to the terms of the draft at the time of acceptance, even if the acceptance specifies that the draft is payable "as originally drawn" or similar wording. If the acceptance alters the terms of the draft, the acceptor is obliged to pay according to the adjusted terms. If the draft was incomplete when accepted, the acceptor must pay according to the terms once it's completed. This obligation is owed to the person who can enforce the draft or the drawer or indorser who paid the draft. 

Furthermore, if the draft states the amount certified or accepted, the acceptor is obliged to pay that amount. If the draft doesn't state an amount and the instrument's amount is raised later, then the acceptor is obliged to pay the amount of the instrument at the time it was taken by the holder in due course.

In simpler terms, this section deals with the obligations of the person accepting a draft or check. It states that they are responsible for paying the amount specified at the time of their acceptance, even if the terms change later. They are also responsible for the payment to the rightful owner of the draft, whether that's the original issuer or a third party who has since obtained the draft. And, if the draft doesn't specify an amount, the acceptor is still responsible for paying the amount that is ultimately decided or negotiated.

(a) This section does not
	apply to cashier's checks or other drafts drawn

(b) If an unaccepted draft is
	dishonored, the drawer is obliged to pay the draft (i)
	according to its terms at the time it was issued or, if
	not issued, at the time it first came into possession of a holder, or (ii) if
	the drawer signed an incomplete instrument,
	according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in Sections 3-115 and 3-407. The
	obligation is owed to a person entitled to
	enforce the draft or to an indorser who paid the
	draft under Section 3-415.
(c) If a draft is
	accepted by a bank, the drawer is discharged, regardless
	of when or by whom acceptance was obtained.
(d) If a draft is
	accepted and the acceptor is not a bank, the obligation
	of the drawer to pay the draft if the draft is dishonored
	by the acceptor is the same as the obligation of an indorser under
	Section 3-415(a) and (c).
(e) If a draft states
	that it is drawn "without recourse" or otherwise disclaims liability
	of the drawer to pay the draft, the drawer is not liable
	under subsection (b) to pay the draft if the draft is not a check. A
	disclaimer of the liability stated in subsection (b) is not effective if the
	draft is a check.
(f) If (i) a check is
	not presented for payment or given to a depositary bank for collection within
	30 days after its date, (ii) the drawee suspends payments
	after expiration of the 30-day period without paying the check, and (iii) because
	of the suspension of payments, the drawer is deprived
	of funds maintained with the drawee to cover payment of the check, the drawer
	to the extent deprived of funds may discharge its obligation to pay the check
	by assigning to the person entitled to enforce the
	check the rights of the drawer against the drawee with respect to the funds.

### commentary on ## § 3-414. OBLIGATION	OF DRAWER.


This section provides details on the obligations of the drawer of a draft (a type of negotiable instrument, such as a check). 

Subsection (a) clarifies that this section does not apply to cashier's checks or drafts drawn on the drawer. 

Subsection (b) states that if an unaccepted draft is dishonored, the drawer is required to pay according to the terms at the time it was issued or when it first came into possession of a holder. If the drawer signed an incomplete instrument, they must pay according to its terms when completed.

Subsection (c) indicates that if a draft is accepted by a bank, the drawer is discharged from any obligation.

Subsection (d) states that if a draft is accepted by a non-bank entity, the drawer’s obligation to pay if the draft is dishonored is equivalent to the obligation of an indorser. 

Subsection (e) explains that if a draft states it is drawn “without recourse” or disclaims liability of the drawer, the drawer is not liable to pay the draft unless it is a check.

Subsection (f) outlines conditions under which a drawer may discharge its obligation to pay a check: if the check is not presented for payment or given to a bank for collection within 30 days, the drawee suspends payments without paying the check, and deprivation of funds is due to suspension of payments. 

In simpler terms, this section lays out the responsibilities of the person (drawer) who writes a check or draft, and the scenarios in which they can be freed of obligation to pay.

## § 3-415. OBLIGATION	OF INDORSER.


Primary tabs







(a) Subject to subsections
	(b), (c), and (d) and to Section 3-419(d), if an instrument is
	dishonored, an indorser is obliged to pay the amount
	due on the instrument (i) according to the terms of the instrument at the time
	it was indorsed, or (ii) if the indorser indorsed an incomplete
	instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated
	in Sections 3-115 and 3-407. The
	obligation of the indorser is owed to a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument or to a subsequent indorser who paid
	the instrument under this section.
(b) If an indorsement states
	that it is made "without recourse" or otherwise disclaims liability
	of the indorser, the indorser is not liable under subsection (a) to pay the instrument.
(c) If notice of dishonor
	of an instrument is required by Section 3-503 and
	notice of dishonor complying with that section is not given to an indorser,
	the liability of the indorser under subsection (a) is discharged.
(d) If a draft is
	accepted by a bank after an indorsement is made,
	the liability of the indorser under subsection (a) is
	discharged.
(e) If an indorser of
	a check is liable under subsection (a) and the check is
	not presented for payment, or given to a depositary bank for collection, within
	30 days after the day the indorsement was made, the
	liability of the indorser under subsection (a) is discharged.

(a) Unless otherwise stated, if an instrument (like a check or promissory note) is dishonored, the Indorser is liable to pay the amount due according to the terms of the instrument at the time of indorsement, or as per its terms when completed, in case it was incomplete at the time of indorsement. The Indorser owes this obligation to the person entitled to enforce the instrument or to a subsequent Indorser who paid the instrument under this section.

(b) If the Indorser's endorsement explicitly states "without recourse" or otherwise disclaims liability, they are not liable to pay the instrument.

(c) If a notice of dishonor is required by Section 3-503 and is not given to the Indorser, their liability is discharged.

(d) If a draft is accepted by a bank after an endorsement is made, the Indorser's liability is discharged.

(e) If an Indorser of a check is liable under subsection (a) and the check is not presented for payment or given to a depositary bank for collection within 30 days after the indorsement, the Indorser's liability is discharged.

Imagine a friend who has borrowed money from another friend and then turns to you for help with repayment. By signing on to assist, you become an "indorser" of sorts. Now, if your friend defaults, you would be obligated to repay the debt, unless you specifically stated that you are helping "without recourse" or if your agreement is not honored within a certain timeframe (30 days in this case). If the debt is settled by another party (a bank, for example), your obligation would also be discharged.

## § 3-416. TRANSFER	WARRANTIES.


Primary tabs







(a) A person who transfers
	an instrument for consideration warrants
	to the transferee and, if the transfer is by indorsement,
	to any subsequent transferee that:
(1) the warrantor is a person
		entitled to enforce the instrument;
(2) all signatures on the instrument are
	authentic and authorized;
(3) the instrument has not been
	altered;
(4) the instrument is not subject
	to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which
	can be asserted against the warrantor; and
(5) the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding
	commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or,
	in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer;
	and 
(6) with respect to a remotely-created consumer item,
	that the person on whose account the item is drawn authorized the issuance of
	the	item in the amount for which the item is drawn. 
(b) A person to whom the warranties
	under subsection (a) are made and who took the instrument in good
	faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an
	amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than
	the amount of the instrument plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as
	a result of the breach.
(c) The warranties stated
	in subsection (a) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless
	notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30
	days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of
	the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection (b) is discharged
	to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
(d) A [cause of action] for
	breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to

### commentary on ## § 3-416. TRANSFER	WARRANTIES.


This section outlines the warranties or guarantees made by a person who transfers a negotiable instrument, such as a check or promissory note, for consideration. The warrantor is assuring the transferee and subsequent transferees in case of endorsement, that they are a legitimate holder of the instrument, all signatures are genuine and authorized, the instrument hasn't been altered, there are no defenses or claims that can be invoked against it, and they aren't aware of any insolvency proceedings related to the maker or acceptor of the instrument. In the case of remotely-created consumer items, the warrantor also assures that the person whose account the item is drawn from gave requisite authorization.

The transferee, if they took the instrument in good faith, can recover damages from the warrantor, if any of these warranties are breached. The damages awarded are equivalent to the loss suffered due to the breach, but can't exceed the value of the instrument, plus expenses and loss of interest due to the breach.

These warranties can't be disclaimed for checks. If a claim for breach of warranty isn't reported to the warrantor within 30 days of the claimant knowing about the breach and the warrantor, the warrantor's liability is relieved to the extent of the loss caused by the delay in reporting. 

A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section occurs when the claimant becomes aware of the breach. The previous section, 3-415, discusses the obligations of an endorser while the next one, 3-417, deals with presentment warranties.

## § 3-417. PRESENTMENT	WARRANTIES.


Primary tabs







(a) If an unaccepted draft is
	presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and
	the drawee pays or accepts the draft, (i) the person obtaining payment or acceptance,
	at the time of presentment, and (ii) a previous transferor
	of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee making payment
	or accepting the draft in good faith that:
(1) the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor
	transferred the draft, a person
	entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance
	of the draft on behalf of a person entitled
	to enforce the draft;
(2) the draft has not been altered; 
(3) the warrantor has no knowledge that the signature
	of	the drawer of the draft is unauthorized;
(4) with respect to any remotely-created consumer item,
	that the person on whose account the item is drawn authorized the issuance of
	the item in the amount for which the item is drawn.
(b) A drawee making
	payment may recover from any warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal
	to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled
	to receive from the drawer because of the payment. In
	addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest
	resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages
	under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary
	care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft,
	breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor. If
	the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled
	to recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this
	subsection.
(c) If a drawee asserts
	a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized indorsement of
	the draft or an alteration of
	the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective
	under Section 3-404 or 3-405 or
	the drawer is precluded under Section 3-406 or 4-406 from
	asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.
(d) If (i) a dishonored draft is
	presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or
	(ii) any other instrument is presented for payment
	to a party obliged to pay the instrument, and (iii) payment
	is received, the following rules apply:
(1) The person obtaining payment and a prior transferor
	of the instrument warrant to the person making payment
	in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the
	time the warrantor transferred the instrument, a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized
	to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled
	to enforce the instrument.
(2) The person making payment may recover from any
	warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses
	and loss of interest resulting from the breach.
(e) The warranties stated
	in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless
	notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30
	days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of
	the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection (b) or (d) is
	discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of
	the claim.
(f) A [cause of action] for
	breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to
	know of the breach.

### commentary on ## § 3-417. PRESENTMENT	WARRANTIES.


This section outlines warranties that apply when an unaccepted draft is presented for payment or acceptance. 

Under subsection (a), the person obtaining payment or acceptance and any previous transferor of the draft guarantee to the drawee that: (i) they are entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to do so on behalf of someone else; (ii) the draft has not been altered; (iii) they have no knowledge of an unauthorized signature; (iv) the amount drawn on a remotely-created consumer item is authorized.

Under subsection (b), if these warranties are breached, the drawee can recover damages from any warrantor. This includes the amount paid, less any amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer, and also compensation for expenses and loss of interest.

Subsection (c) outlines the defenses available to a warrantor against a claim for breach of warranty.

Subsection (d) provides similar warranties for when a dishonored draft or any other instrument is presented for payment.

Under subsection (e), these warranties can't be disclaimed for checks. If notice of a claim for breach of warranty isn't given within 30 days, the warrantor's liability is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay.

Finally, subsection (f) establishes that a cause of action for breach of warranty accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach. 

In essence, these regulations serve to safeguard the interests of the parties involved in the transaction of a draft, ensuring its authenticity, validity, and correct execution.

## § 3-418. PAYMENT	OR ACCEPTANCE BY MISTAKE.


Primary tabs







(a) Except as provided in
	subsection (c), if the drawee of a draft pays
	or accepts the draft and the drawee acted on the mistaken belief that (i) payment
	of the draft had not been stopped pursuant to Section 4-403 or
	(ii) the signature of the drawer of the draft was authorized,
	the drawee may recover the amount of the draft from the person to whom or for
	whose benefit payment was made or, in the case of acceptance,
	may revoke the acceptance. Rights of the drawee under this subsection
	are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary
	care in paying or accepting the draft.
(b) Except as provided in
	subsection (c), if an instrument has been paid or
	accepted by mistake and the case is not covered by subsection (a), the person
	paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law governing mistake
	and restitution, (i) recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose
	benefit payment was made or (ii) in the case of acceptance,
	may revoke the acceptance.
(c) The remedies provided
	by subsection (a) or (b) may not be asserted against a person who took the instrument in good
	faith and for value or who in good faith changed position in reliance on
	the payment or acceptance. This subsection does
	not limit remedies provided by Section 3-417 or 4-407.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 4-215,
	if an instrument is paid or accepted by mistake and
	the payor or acceptor recovers payment or revokes acceptance under
	subsection (a) or (b), the instrument is deemed not to have been paid or accepted
	and is treated as dishonored, and the person from whom payment is recovered
	has rights as a person entitled to enforce the
	dishonored instrument.

### commentary on ## § 3-418. PAYMENT	OR ACCEPTANCE BY MISTAKE.


This section of the law details what happens when a draft is paid or accepted due to mistaken belief or error. This can be when a drawee, the person or entity on whom a draft (like a check) is drawn, makes payment believing that a stop payment order hasn't been issued, or that the drawer's (person who wrote the draft) signature is legitimate, when it's not.

In such cases, the drawee can reclaim the paid amount from the person who received the payment or benefitted from it, or revoke acceptance of the draft. The law, however, protects those who received the payment in good faith and for value.

This section also asserts that if payment or acceptance is revoked due to a mistake, the instrument (like a check or promissory note) is considered as dishonored (not paid or accepted) and the person from whom the payment is recovered has the rights to enforce the dishonored instrument.

In simple terms, if you mistakenly pay or accept money through a check or similar instrument, you're allowed to take it back or cancel your acceptance. However, if someone innocently benefits from this mistake, you can't hold them responsible. Additionally, if you do take back a mistaken payment, it's as if the check was never paid or accepted, and the person you got the money back from can then try to collect on the bounced check.

## § 3-419. INSTRUMENTS	SIGNED FOR ACCOMMODATION.


Primary tabs







(a) If an instrument is issued for
	value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument
	("accommodated
	party") and another party to the instrument ("accommodation
	party") signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability
	on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for
	the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for
	accommodation."
(b) An accommodation party
	may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor,
	or indorser and, subject to subsection (d), is obliged
	to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs. The
	obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute
	of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for
	the accommodation.
(c) A person signing an instrument is
	presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument
	is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous
	indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting
	as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to
	the instrument. Except as provided in Section 3-605,
	the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected
	by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument
	was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument
	for accommodation.
(d) If the signature of a party to
	an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously
	that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation
	of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount
	due on the instrument to a person entitled
	to enforce the instrument only if (i) execution of judgment against the
	other party has been returned unsatisfied, (ii) the other party is insolvent
	or in an insolvency proceeding, (iii) the other party cannot be served with
	process, or (iv) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from
	the other party.
(e) If the signature of a party to
	an instrument is accompanied by words indicating that
	the party guarantees payment or the signer signs the instrument as an accommodation
	party in some other manner that does not unambiguously indicate an intention
	to guarantee collection rather than payment, the signer is obliged to pay the
	amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument
	in the same circumstances as the accommodated party would be obliged, without
	prior resort to the accommodated party by the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument.
(f) An accommodation party
	who	pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement
	from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against
	the	accommodated party. In proper circumstances, an accommodation party
	may obtain relief that requires the accommodated party to perform its obligations
	on the instrument. An accommodated party that pays the instrument has no right
	of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation
	party.

§ 3-420. CONVERSION	OF INSTRUMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-419. INSTRUMENTS	SIGNED FOR ACCOMMODATION.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) discusses the responsibilities and rights of accommodation parties who sign financial instruments, such as checks or promissory notes, to help another party (the accommodated party) obtain credit or funds. 

Section (a) defines an accommodation party as someone who signs a financial instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the instrument, essentially acting as a guarantor for the accommodated party. 

Section (b) provides that regardless of their role (maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser), an accommodation party is obligated to pay the instrument and this obligation can be enforced even without any formal agreement or direct benefit to them. 

Section (c) adds that an individual signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party if the signature is anomalous or accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as a guarantor. 

Section (d) specifies that if a party unambiguously indicates they are guaranteeing collection rather than payment, their obligation to pay only arises if the primary obligor defaults for reasons such as insolvency or inability to be served with process. 

Section (e) explains that if a party does not clearly express an intention to guarantee just collection, they are assumed to be guaranteeing payment and thus are obliged to pay in the same circumstances as the accommodated party.

Finally, Section (f) stipulates that an accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and can enforce the instrument against them. However, an accommodated party that pays the instrument cannot seek contribution from the accommodation party. 

In simpler terms, this law outlines the rules for situations where someone co-signs a check or other financial document to help another person. Depending on the specifics, the co-signer might be responsible for paying the debt if the original party can't or won't, and they can also seek reimbursement from that party.

## § 3-420. CONVERSION	OF INSTRUMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) The law applicable to
	conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An
	instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation,
	from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains
	payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce
	the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument
	may not be brought by (i) the issuer or acceptor of
	the instrument or (ii) a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the
	instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.
(b) In an action under subsection
	(a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument,
	but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.
(c) A representative, other
	than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt
	with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one
	who was not the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any
	proceeds that it has not paid out.

### commentary on ## § 3-420. CONVERSION	OF INSTRUMENT.


This law states that the regulation of personal property conversion applies to instruments (legal documents like checks or promissory notes). Conversion here refers to the act of wrongfully possessing or using property belonging to another party without their permission. This law also expands the definition of conversion to include situations where an instrument is transferred from a person who doesn't have the right to enforce the instrument, or when a bank makes or acquires payment for a person who isn't entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.

The law also stipulates that the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or a payee or indorsee who didn't receive the delivery of the instrument either directly or via an agent or co-payee cannot bring an action for conversion of the instrument.

The measure of liability in a conversion action is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but the recovery cannot exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument. 

Lastly, a representative who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of someone who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument, is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out, as long as they are not a depositary bank.

	a demand made by or on behalf of a person
	entitled to enforce an instrument (i) to pay the
	instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged
	to pay the instrument or, in the case of a note or accepted draft payable
	at a bank, to the bank, or (ii) to accept a draft made to the drawee.
(b) The following rules are
	subject to Article 4, agreement of the parties, and clearing-house rules and

(1) Presentment may be made at the place of payment
	of the instrument and must be made at the place of
	payment if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States; may be

	(ii) give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of
	another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so, and (iii) sign a
	receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if
	full payment is made.
(3) Without dishonoring the instrument,
	the party to whom presentment is
	made may (i) return the instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement,
	or (ii) refuse payment or acceptance for failure of
	the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of
	the parties, or other applicable law or rule.
(4) The party to whom presentment is
	made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day after the day
	of presentment if the party to whom presentment is made has established a cut-off
	hour not earlier than 2 p.m. for the receipt and processing of instruments presented
	for payment or acceptance and presentment is made
	after the cut-off hour.

### commentary on ## § 3-501. PRESENTMENT.


"Presentment" in this section refers to the act of demanding payment or acceptance of an instrument by or on behalf of the person entitled to enforce the instrument. Presentment can be made by any commercially reasonable means, including oral, written or electronic communication. Moreover, it is effective when the demand is received by the person to whom it is made.

The rules laid out in this section govern presentment, and can be superseded by Article 4, agreements between parties, and rules of clearing houses. The rules specify that presentment should be made at the place of payment, especially if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States.

If demanded, the person making the presentment must exhibit the instrument, provide reasonable identification and proof of authority to act on behalf of another person, and sign a receipt or surrender the instrument if full payment is made.

The party to whom the presentment is made can refuse the instrument if it lacks a necessary endorsement, or if the presentment does not comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule. The party also has the right to treat the presentment as occurring on the next business day if the presentment was made after a set cut-off hour, which cannot be earlier than 2 p.m.

To put it simply, this section lays out the rules and protocols for demanding payment or acceptance of financial instruments, with specific considerations for the location, timing and conditions of the demand.

## § 3-502. DISHONOR.









(a) Dishonor of a note is
	governed by the following rules:
(1) If the note is payable on
	demand, the note is dishonored if presentment is
	duly made to the maker and the note is not paid on the
	day of presentment.
(2) If the note is not payable
	on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment,
	the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid
	on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.
(3) If the note is not payable
	on demand and paragraph (2) does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is
	not paid on the day it becomes payable.
(b) Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other
	than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules:
(1) If a check is duly presented
	for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the
	counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank makes timely return of the
	check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under Section 4-301 or 4-302,
	or becomes accountable for the amount of the check under
	Section 4-302.
(2) If a draft is payable on
	demand and paragraph (1) does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for
	payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not
	paid on the day of presentment.
(3) If a draft is payable on
	a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if (i) presentment for
	payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not
	made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever
	is later, or (ii) presentment for acceptance is duly
	made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted
	on the day of presentment.
(4) If a draft is payable on
	elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance,
	the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance

	documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated
	in subsection (b)(2), (3), and (4), except that payment or acceptance may
	be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business
	day of the drawee following the day on which payment or
	acceptance is required by those paragraphs.
(d) Dishonor of an accepted draft is
	governed by the following rules:
(1) If the draft is payable

(2) If the draft is not payable
	on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for
	payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is
	not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever
	is later.
(e) In any case in which presentment is
	otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused
	under Section 3-504, dishonor occurs without presentment
	if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.
(f) If a draft is
	dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft

### commentary on ## § 3-502. DISHONOR.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code sets out the rules for when a note or draft (types of financial instruments) is considered to be dishonored. 

For notes:
- If the note is payable on demand, it is dishonored if it is presented to the maker and is not paid on the day of presentment.
- If the note is not payable on demand but requires presentment, it is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.
- If the note is not payable on demand and presentment is not required, it is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable.

For draft:
- If a check is presented for payment to the payor bank and is not paid, it is dishonored.
- If a draft is payable on demand and is not paid on the day of presentment, it is dishonored.
- If a draft is payable on a specific date and is not paid on that date or the date of presentment, it is dishonored.
- If a draft is payable after a period of time and is not accepted on the day of presentment, it is dishonored.

The section also outlines rules for when dishonor occurs when presentment is excused, and when a draft is treated as not having been dishonored if late acceptance is consented to. 

In simple terms, this section is like the "rules of the road" for financial transactions using notes and drafts. It sets out when a note or draft is considered to be "in default" or "bounced".

	indorser or drawer is given notice of dishonor of the instrument complying
	with this section or (ii) notice of dishonor is excused under Section 3-504(b).
(b) Notice of dishonor may
	be given by any person; may be given by any commercially reasonable means, including
	an oral, written, or electronic communication; and is sufficient if it reasonably
	identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument
	has been dishonored or has not been paid or accepted. Return of an instrument

(c) Subject to Section 3-504(c),
	with respect to an instrument taken for collection
	by a collecting bank, notice of dishonor must be given (i) by the bank before
	midnight of the next banking day following the banking day on which the bank
	receives notice of dishonor of the instrument, or (ii) by any other person within
	30 days following the day on which the person receives notice of dishonor. With

§ 3-503 of the Uniform Commercial Code relates to the notice of dishonor, which is a crucial part of the process when a financial instrument, such as a check or a promissory note, is not paid or accepted. 

In layman's terms:

(a) The people who endorsed (signed on the back of the check to endorse it to someone else) or wrote the check can't be held responsible unless they are given a notice that the check was not honored by the bank (because of insufficient funds for example), or unless this notice is excused under some specific circumstances.

(b) Anyone can give this notice of dishonor, it can be given in any way that makes sense in the business world - in person, in writing or electronically. It just needs to be clear enough about which check it relates to and that the check was not honored. If a bank returns a check that was given to it for collection, that's good enough as a notice of dishonor.

(c) If a collecting bank is dealing with a check, they need to give notice of dishonor by the end of the next banking day after they receive the notice themselves. If it's not a bank, but someone else, they have 30 days to give this notice. For any other type of financial instrument, the notice needs to be given within 30 days of the instrument not being honored. 

In short, if a check or similar financial instrument isn't accepted or paid, the person responsible needs to be notified, and there are rules about how and when this notification has to happen.

## § 3-504. EXCUSED	PRESENTMENT AND NOTICE OF DISHONOR.


Primary tabs







(a) Presentment for payment
	or acceptance of an instrument is
	excused if (i) the person entitled to present the instrument cannot with reasonable
	diligence make presentment, (ii) the maker or acceptor has
	repudiated an obligation to pay the instrument or is dead or in insolvency proceedings,
	(iii) by the terms of the instrument presentment is
	not necessary to enforce the obligation of indorsers or
	the drawer, (iv) the drawer or indorser whose obligation
	is being enforced has waived presentment or otherwise
	has no reason to expect or right to require that the instrument be paid or accepted,
	or (v) the drawer instructed the drawee not to pay or
	accept the draft or the drawee was not obligated to the
	drawer to pay the draft.
(b) Notice of dishonor is
	excused if (i) by the terms of the instrument notice
	of dishonor is not necessary to enforce the obligation of a party to
	pay the instrument, or (ii) the party whose obligation is being enforced waived
	notice of dishonor. A waiver of presentment is
	also a waiver of notice of dishonor.
(c) Delay in giving notice
	of dishonor is excused if the delay was caused by circumstances beyond the control
	of the person giving the notice and the person giving the notice exercised reasonable
	diligence after the cause of the delay ceased to operate.

### commentary on ## § 3-504. EXCUSED	PRESENTMENT AND NOTICE OF DISHONOR.


This section of the law explains when presentment for payment or acceptance of an instrument is excused, i.e., not required. Some examples include when the person entitled to present the instrument can't do so with reasonable diligence, the maker has repudiated their obligation to pay, the drawer or indorser has waived presentment, or the drawer instructed the drawee not to pay the draft.

It also covers when notice of dishonor (i.e., a notice that payment or acceptance has not been made) is excused. This can happen if the terms of the instrument state that notice of dishonor isn't necessary, or if the party whose obligation is being enforced waived notice of dishonor. Importantly, waiving presentment also means waiving notice of dishonor.

Finally, this section of the law excuses delays in giving notice of dishonor if they were caused by circumstances beyond the person's control and if that person acted with reasonable diligence after the cause of the delay ended. 

In simpler terms, this section is like a 'get out of jail free' card for those who are unable to meet the standard requirements of presentment or notice under certain circumstances. The law understands that life happens, and there may be legitimate reasons for delays or non-compliance. As long as you can show you were acting reasonably and diligently, you should be excused.

Primary tabs







(a) The following are admissible
	as evidence and create a presumption of dishonor and of any notice of dishonor
	stated:
(1) a document regular in form as provided in subsection
	(b) which purports to be a protest;
(2) a purported stamp or writing of the drawee,
	payor bank, or presenting bank on or accompanying the instrument stating
	that acceptance or payment has been refused unless
	reasons for the refusal are stated and the reasons are not consistent with dishonor;
(3) a book or record of the drawee,
	payor bank, or collecting bank, kept in the usual course of business which shows
	dishonor, even if there is no evidence of who made the entry.
(b) A protest is a certificate
	of dishonor made by a United States consul or vice consul, or a notary public
	or other person authorized to administer oaths by the law of the place where
	dishonor occurs. It may be made upon information satisfactory to that
	person. The protest must identify the instrument and
	certify either that presentment has been made or,
	if not made, the reason why it was not made, and that the instrument has been
	dishonored by nonacceptance or nonpayment. The protest may also certify
	that notice of dishonor has been given to some or all parties.

### commentary on ## § 3-505. EVIDENCE	OF DISHONOR.


This section of the law deals with what can be considered as evidence for dishonor (non-payment or non-acceptance) of a financial instrument like a check or bill of exchange. Three types of evidence are identified and they are presumed to show dishonor and any notice of dishonor:

1. A document, known as a protest, which is regular in form and purports to be a formal declaration that the instrument has been dishonored.
2. A stamp or writing from the drawee, payor bank, or presenting bank stating that acceptance or payment has been refused, unless there are reasons stated for the refusal which are inconsistent with dishonor.
3. Record kept in the usual course of business by the drawee, payor bank, or collecting bank, which shows dishonor, even if there is no evidence of who made the entry.

The section goes on to describe what a protest is. It is a certificate of dishonor made by a U.S. consul or vice consul, a notary public, or another person authorized to carry out official duties under local law. The protest must identify the instrument, confirm that it has been presented or give a reason for not doing so, and certify that it has been dishonored through non-acceptance or non-payment. The protest can also confirm that notice of dishonor has been given to some or all parties involved. 

In simple terms, this section provides guidance on what constitutes evidence of non-payment or refusal to accept a financial instrument and outlines the formal process of making and recording such an event.

(a) The obligation of a party to

	Article or by an act or agreement with the party which
	would discharge an obligation to pay money under a simple contract.
(b) Discharge of the obligation
	of a party is not effective against a person acquiring
	rights of a holder in due course of the instrument without
	notice of the discharge.

§ 3-602. PAYMENT. ›







### commentary on ## § 3-601. DISCHARGE	AND EFFECT OF DISCHARGE.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) discusses how the obligation of a party to pay a financial instrument can be discharged. 

(a) A party's obligation to pay can be discharged, or eliminated, in two ways. The first way is as specified in the UCC, which might include circumstances like payment in full, or the expiration of the instrument. The second way is through an act or agreement, similar to how a simple contract could be discharged. This could happen, for example, if the parties agree to cancel the instrument or if the party obligated to pay has declared bankruptcy.

(b) However, the discharge of a financial obligation doesn't necessarily affect others who weren't involved in the original agreement. For instance, even if the original parties agree to discharge the obligation, a person who later acquires the instrument as a holder in due course (someone who receives the instrument in good faith and without knowledge of any issues) may still be entitled to enforce the obligation. This means that the person who was originally supposed to pay can still be legally required to pay the holder in due course, despite the discharge. 

In simpler terms, if you write a check and it's cashed, you can't just agree with the person you wrote the check to that you don't have to pay it anymore. If that person already deposited the check, your bank is still going to take the money out of your account. And if the person you wrote the check to sold it to someone else before it was cashed, that person can still enforce the check against you.

## § 3-602. PAYMENT.









(a) Subject to subsection
	(b),	an instrument is paid to the extent payment is
	made	(i) by or on behalf of a party obliged to pay the
	instrument,	and (ii) to a person entitled
	to enforce the instrument. To the extent of the payment, the obligation
	of the party obliged to pay the instrument is discharged even though payment
	is made with	knowledge of a claim to the instrument under Section 3-306 by
	another person.
(b) Subject to subsection (e) a note
	is paid to the extent payment is made by or on behalf of a party obliged
	to pay the note to a person that formerly was entitled to enforce the note only
	if at the time of the payment the party obliged to pay has not received adequate
	notification that the note has been transferred and that payment is to be made
	to the transferee. A notification is adequate only if it is signed by the transferor
	or the transferee; reasonably identifies the transferred note; and provides
	an address at which payments subsequently can be made. Upon request, a transferee
	shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the note has been transferred.
	Unless the transferee complies with the request, a payment to the person that
	formerly was entitled to enforce the note is effective for purposes of subsection
	(c) even if the party obliged to pay the note has received a notification under
	this paragraph. 
(c) Subject to subsection (e), to
	the extent of a payment under subsections (a) and (b), the obligation of the party obliged
	to pay the instrument is discharged even though payment is made with knowledge
	of a claim to the instrument under Section 3-306 by another
	person. 
(d) Subject to subsection (e), a
	transferee,	or any party that has acquired rights in the
	instrument directly or indirectly from a transferee, including any such party
	that has rights as a holder in due course, is deemed to have notice of any payment
	that is made under subsection (b) after the date that the note is transferred
	to the transferee but before the party obliged to pay the note receives adequate
	notification of the transfer. 
(e) The obligation of a party to
	pay the instrument is not discharged under subsections
	(a) through (d) if:
(1) a claim to the instrument under
	Section 3-306 is enforceable against the party receiving
	payment and (i) payment is made with knowledge by the payor that payment is
	prohibited by injunction or similar process of a court of competent jurisdiction,
	or (ii) in the case of an instrument other than a cashier's
	check, teller's check, or certified
	check, the party making payment accepted, from the person having a claim
	to the instrument, indemnity against loss resulting from refusal to pay the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument; or
(2) the person making payment knows that the instrument is
	a stolen instrument and pays a person it knows is in wrongful possession of
	the instrument.
(f) As used in this section, "signed," with
	respect to a record that is not a writing, includes the attachment to or logical
	association with the record of an electronic symbol, sound, or process to or
	with the record with the present intent to adopt or accept the record.

### commentary on ## § 3-602. PAYMENT.


This section provides guidelines on the payment of an instrument, which is any written legal document that records and gives a right to a monetary transaction. 

Subsection (a) states that an instrument is paid when payment is made by or on behalf of the party obligated to pay the instrument to the person entitled to enforce the instrument. The obligation of the party to pay is discharged once payment is made, even if they are aware of another party's claim to the instrument.

Subsection (b) provides that a note (a promise to pay a certain amount of money) is considered paid when payment is made by or on behalf of the party obliged to pay the note to a person who was formerly entitled to enforce the note. However, this is only true if the party obligated to pay has not received adequate notification that the note has been transferred and that payment should be made to the transferee.

Subsection (c) reiterates that the obligation of the party to pay is discharged once payment is made, even if they are aware of another party's claim to the instrument.

Subsection (d) stipulates that a transferee or any party that has acquired rights in the instrument from a transferee is deemed to have notice of any payment made under subsection (b) after the note has been transferred to the transferee but before the party obliged to pay the note receives adequate notification of the transfer. 

Subsection (e) states that the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is not discharged if a claim to the instrument is enforceable against the party receiving payment and the payment is made despite knowledge of a court order prohibiting such payment, or if the person making payment knows that the instrument is stolen and pays a person they know is in wrongful possession of the instrument.

Subsection (f) defines "signed" in the context of an electronic record as the attachment or association of an electronic symbol, sound, or process to the record with the intention to adopt or accept the record.

## § 3-603. TENDER	OF PAYMENT.


Primary tabs







(a) If tender of payment of
	an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument, the effect of tender is governed by
	principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract.
(b) If tender of payment of
	an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge,
	to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an indorser or
	accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect
	to the obligation to which the tender relates.
(c) If tender of payment of
	an amount due on an instrument is made to a person
	entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay
	interest after the due date on the amount tendered is discharged. If presentment is
	required with respect to an instrument and the obligor is able and ready to
	pay on the due date at every place of payment stated in the instrument, the
	obligor is deemed to have made tender of payment on the due date to the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument.

### commentary on ## § 3-603. TENDER	OF PAYMENT.


Section 3-603 discusses the implications of tendering payment for an obligation under an instrument (like a cheque or note). 

Subsection (a) states that if a payment offer is made to a person who has the right to enforce the instrument, the laws governing the tender of payment in a simple contract are applied. This implies that a lawful offer of payment is regarded as satisfying the obligation, unless there’s some contractual agreement stating otherwise. 

Subsection (b) says that if a tender of payment for an obligation is refused by the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the responsibility of an indorser or accommodation party, who has a right of recourse, is discharged to the extent of the amount tendered. This means that if the person entitled to enforce the payment refuses the tender, it relieves the third party (like a guarantor or co-signer) of their obligation to the extent of the amount offered.

Subsection (c) clarifies that if a payment offer is made for an amount due on an instrument to a person entitled to enforce it, the person offering the payment is no longer obligated to pay interest on the amount after the due date. If presentment is required (i.e., formally demanding payment), and the person obligated to pay is ready and able to do so on the due date at every place of payment mentioned in the instrument, they are considered to have made a tender of payment on the due date to the person entitled to enforce the instrument. 

In simpler terms, if you offer to pay what you owe on time and in the right manner, you shouldn’t need to pay extra interest. If the person who should be accepting your payment refuses, it may also relieve others who might have had to pay on your behalf.

(a) A person
		entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration,

### commentary on ## § 3-604. DISCHARGE	BY CANCELLATION OR RENUNCIATION.


The section describes how the obligation to pay an instrument can be discharged by the person who is entitled to enforce it. The discharge can occur through a voluntary act like surrendering, destroying, or cancelling the instrument, or by the person agreeing not to sue or renouncing their rights against the party. However, cancelling an endorsement does not affect the status and rights of a party that come from the endorsement. The section also defines what "signed" means in relation to a record that is not a writing.

In simpler terms, this law outlines how a person, who has the right to enforce payment on a check or promissory note, can freely choose to let the debtor off the hook. They can do this by either physically altering the instrument or by formally agreeing not to sue the debtor. Interestingly, if an endorsement (a signature on the back of a check, for example) is cancelled, the rights of the party that came from that endorsement stay intact. The law also clarifies that signing can also mean attaching an electronic symbol, sound, or process to a record. 

In terms of timeline, this law is likely an evolution of how contracts and obligations have been managed and discharged. In the past, physical actions such as destroying or surrendering the instrument were common, but in the digital age, electronic symbols or processes can also serve as signatures. 

A possible counterpart in common law might be the concept of "accord and satisfaction," where a dispute is settled by the parties agreeing to accept less than what's owed, effectively discharging the obligation.

## § 3-605. DISCHARGE	OF SECONDARY OBLIGORS.


Primary tabs







(a) If a person
		entitled to enforce an instrument releases the
		obligation of a principal obligor in whole or in part, and another party to
		the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to the obligation of that
		principal obligor, the following rules apply: 
(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary
	obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not
	affected. Unless the terms of the release preserve the secondary obligor's recourse,
	the principal obligor is discharged, to the extent of the release, from any
	other duties to the secondary obligor under this article. 
(2) Unless the terms of the release provide that the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the instrument
	against the secondary obligor, the secondary obligor is discharged to the same
	extent as the principal obligor from any unperformed portion of its obligation
	on the instrument. If the instrument is a check and the obligation of the secondary
	obligor is based on an indorsement of the check, the secondary obligor is discharged
	without regard to the language or circumstances of the discharge or other release. 
(3) If the secondary obligor is not discharged under paragraph
	(2), the secondary obligor is discharged to the extent of the value of the consideration
	for the release, and to the extent that the release would otherwise cause the
	secondary obligor a loss. 
(b) If a person
		entitled to enforce an instrument grants a principal
		obligor an extension of the time at which one or more payments are due on the
		instrument and another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with
		respect	to the obligation of that principal obligor, the following rules apply: 
(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary
	obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not
	affected. Unless the terms of the extension preserve the secondary obligor's
	recourse, the extension correspondingly extends the time for performance of
	any other duties owed to the secondary obligor by the principal obligor under
	this article. 
(2) The secondary obligor is discharged to the extent
	that	the extension would otherwise cause the secondary obligor a loss. 
(3) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged
	under paragraph (2), the secondary obligor may perform its obligations to a
	person entitled to enforce the instrument as if the time for payment had not
	been extended or, unless the terms of the extension provide that the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the instrument
	against the secondary obligor as if the time for payment had not been extended,
	treat the time for performance of its obligations as having been extended correspondingly. 
(c) If a person
		entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with
		or without consideration, to a modification of
		the obligation of a principal obligor other than a complete or partial release
		or an extension of the due date and another party to the instrument is a secondary
		obligor with respect to the obligation of that principal obligor, the following
		rules apply: 
(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary
	obligor with respect to any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not
	affected. The modification correspondingly modifies any other duties owed to
	the secondary obligor by the principal obligor under this article. 
(2) The secondary obligor is discharged from any unperformed
	portion of its obligation to the extent that the modification would otherwise
	cause the secondary obligor a loss. 
(3) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged
	under paragraph (2), the secondary obligor may satisfy its obligation on the
	instrument as if the modification had not occurred, or treat its obligation
	on the instrument as having been modified correspondingly. 
(d) If the obligation of a principal
	obligor is secured by an interest in collateral, another party to
	the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to that obligation, and a
	person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest
	in collateral, the obligation of the secondary obligor is discharged to the
	extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired
	to the extent the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the
	amount of the recourse of the secondary obligor, or the reduction in value of
	the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the recourse
	exceeds the value of the interest. For purposes of this subsection, impairing
	the value of an interest in collateral includes failure to obtain or maintain
	perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, release of collateral
	without substitution of collateral of equal value or equivalent reduction of
	the underlying obligation, failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of
	collateral owed, under Article 9 or other law, to a debtor or other person secondarily
	liable, and failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of or otherwise
	enforcing the interest in collateral. 
(e) A secondary obligor is not discharged
	under subsection (a)(3), (b), (c), or (d) unless the person
	entitled to enforce the instrument knows that
	the person is a secondary obligor or has notice under Section 3-419(c) that
	the instrument was signed for accommodation. 
(f) A secondary obligor is not discharged
	under this section if the secondary obligor consents to the event or conduct
	that is the basis of the discharge, or the instrument or a separate agreement
	of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section specifically
	or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship
	or impairment of collateral. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, consent
	by the principal obligor to an act that would lead to a discharge under this
	section constitutes consent to that act by the secondary obligor if the secondary
	obligor controls the principal obligor or deals with the person entitled to
	enforce the instrument on behalf of the principal obligor. 
(g) A release or extension preserves
	a secondary obligor's recourse if the terms of the release or extension provide
	that the person entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce
	the instrument against the secondary obligor; and the recourse of the secondary
	obligor continues as though the release or extension had not been granted. 
(h) Except as otherwise provided
	in subsection (i), a secondary obligor asserting discharge under this section
	has the burden of persuasion both with respect to the occurrence of the acts
	alleged to harm the secondary obligor and loss or prejudice caused by those
	acts. 
(i) If the secondary obligor demonstrates
	prejudice caused by an impairment of its recourse, and the circumstances of
	the case indicate that the amount of loss is not reasonably susceptible of calculation
	or requires proof of facts that are not ascertainable, it is presumed that the
	act impairing recourse caused a loss or impairment equal to the liability of
	the secondary obligor on the instrument. In that event, the burden of persuasion
	as to any lesser amount of the loss is on the person entitled to enforce the
	instrument.

### commentary on ## § 3-605. DISCHARGE	OF SECONDARY OBLIGORS.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) addresses how secondary obligors, or co-signers, are affected when the principal obligor, or main signer, of a financial instrument is released from their obligations in part or in entirety. It also outlines how extensions, modifications, or impairments of collateral to the principal’s obligation affect the secondary obligor. 

In summary, it explains that:

- If the principal obligor is released from their obligation, the secondary obligor is also discharged to the same extent, unless the terms of the release state otherwise.

- If the principal obligor is granted an extension, the secondary obligor's obligations are also extended, unless it would cause them a loss. 

- If the obligation is modified, the secondary obligor's obligations are also modified, unless it would cause them a loss. 

- If the value of collateral is impaired, the secondary obligor is released to the extent of the impairment. 

- The secondary obligor is not released unless the person enforcing the instrument knows that they are a secondary obligor or has been notified that the instrument was signed for accommodation.

- A secondary obligor is not released if they consent to the event or conduct causing the release, or if they waive their discharge rights. 

- A secondary obligor retains the right of recourse if the release or extension terms provide for it. 

- The secondary obligor has the burden of proving the occurrence of harmful acts and the loss caused by them.

- If the secondary obligor shows prejudice caused by an impairment of recourse and the loss is not calculable, it is assumed that the impairment caused a loss equal to their liability on the instrument, unless proven otherwise.

Negotiation, in terms of a negotiable instrument such as a check or promissory note, refers to the transfer of the instrument from one party to another in such a way that the transferee becomes the holder. If an instrument is payable to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery; if it is payable to order, it is negotiated by the owner's signature and delivery.

§ 3-202. NEGOTIATION	SUBJECT TO RESCISSION
This section indicates that negotiation is effectively reversible or voidable. In other words, if a negotiable instrument was transferred under fraudulent or illegal circumstances, the negotiation can be rescinded.

§ 3-203. TRANSFER	OF INSTRUMENT; RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY TRANSFER
This section discusses how a transferee acquires the rights to a negotiable instrument. When a negotiable instrument is transferred, the transferee obtains the same rights as the transferor. 

§ 3-204. INDORSEMENT
Endorsement refers to the act of a payee or holder signing a negotiable instrument, such as a check, to transfer ownership to another party. This section provides details on how an endorsement should occur.

§ 3-205. SPECIAL	INDORSEMENT; BLANK INDORSEMENT; ANOMALOUS INDORSEMENT
Here, three types of endorsement are discussed. A special endorsement specifies the person to whom the instrument is to be payable. A blank endorsement does not specify a payee, making the instrument payable to the bearer. An anomalous endorsement is one made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument.

§ 3-206. RESTRICTIVE	INDORSEMENT
This section refers to an endorsement that includes certain restrictions regarding the use of the instrument.

§ 3-207. REACQUISITION
Reacquisition refers to a situation where a party that had previously disposed of a negotiable instrument acquires it again. This section addresses how a negotiable instrument can be reacquired and the rights of the parties involved in such transactions.
