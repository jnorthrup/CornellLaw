### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4301 -  Designation of chapter 


The U.S. Code section 4301, officially titled as the "Trading With The Enemy Act", is a significant piece of legislation that was first enacted on October 6, 1917. This Act is designed to prohibit and regulate trade with countries considered as enemies of the U.S. 

In simpler terms, this section of the U.S. Code is basically the country's "No Trading With Bad Guys" rule. It was originally created during World War I, when there were clear-cut "enemies" to the U.S. This law serves as the official stamp on who the U.S. can and can't do business with.

However, just like that one rule at school that no one really knows why it's there but it's been around since forever, this act has been in place for over a century, and while the world has changed a lot since 1917, this law has pretty much stayed the same. 

It's been tweaked and updated over the years, but the basic idea remains intact - if a country is considered an enemy, the U.S. can't trade with them. It's like the country's version of your mom telling you not to hang out with the bad kids on the block. 

It's also worth noting that this piece of legislation has played a significant role in U.S. history, affecting relations with countries like Cuba, North Korea, and Iran among others.

So, the next time you're discussing international trade regulations or need a conversation starter at a party, just bring up the "Trading With The Enemy Act". You'll either impress people with your knowledge or send them running in the other direction. Either way, it's a win!

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4303 -  Acts prohibited 


This section of the U.S. Code specifically outlines certain actions that are prohibited when the United States is at war. It essentially forbids any person from:

1. Trading or attempting to trade with any person known to be an enemy of the United States, or an ally of an enemy, unless licensed to do so by the President.

2. Transporting or attempting to transport any citizen or subject of an enemy nation into or out of the United States, unless licensed by the President to do so.

3. Sending or attempting to send any form of communication into or out of the United States, unless this is done through regular mail or if the person is a government official. This includes any sort of tangible written communication, including letters, books, maps, plans, paper, pictures, telegrams, cablegrams or wireless messages. This rule can be circumvented if the person can obtain the President's license or consent.

4. Evading or attempting to evade the censorship of any form of communication that is being sent between the United States and a foreign country during a war. This includes using code or other devices to hide the intended meaning of the communication. Any person caught doing this may be punished according to section 4315 of the title.

The section also gives the President the power to censor communications during a war if he believes that it is necessary for public safety. The President can establish rules and regulations for this censorship as he sees fit.

In essence, this law puts restrictions on communicating or trading with enemy nations during times of war, unless given explicit permission by the President. It was originally enacted in 1917, during World War I, and has been used in subsequent wars to control and restrict interactions with enemy nations.

(b)
 During the present war, no enemy, or ally of enemy, and no partnership of which he is a member or was a member at the beginning of the war, shall for any purpose assume or use any name other than that by which such enemy or partnership was ordinarily known at the beginning of the war, except under license from the President.Whenever, during the present war, in the opinion of the President the public safety or public interest requires, the President may prohibit any or all foreign insurance companies from doing business in the United States, or the President may license such company or companies to do business upon such terms as he may deem proper.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4304 -  Licenses to enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance companies; change of name; doing business in United States 


This section of the U.S. Code addresses the operation of insurance or reinsurance companies that are identified as enemies or allies of enemies during times of war. These companies, if they wish to continue operating within the United States, must apply for a license from the President within 30 days of the designation. The President can grant or refuse the license and may include conditions to ensure the safety of the United States. The license can be temporary, revoked, regranted, or renewed at the President's discretion.

Companies not applying for a license or having their license refused or revoked are subject to certain restrictions. The law also prohibits these companies from transmitting funds out of the U.S. or using such funds to create credit that benefits an enemy.

The law also prohibits enemies or allies of enemy from changing their business name during the war, unless they have permission from the President. Additionally, the President has the power to prohibit foreign insurance companies from operating in the U.S. if deemed necessary for public safety or interest.

The law was enacted on October 6, 1917, during World War I.

Notable provisions from past Presidential proclamations include that German insurance companies were allowed to continue operations subject to state regulations but were prohibited from transmitting any funds outside the U.S. without the Federal Government's permission.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4305 -  Suspension of provisions relating to ally of enemy; regulation of transactions in foreign exchange of gold or silver, property transfers, vested interests, enforcement and penalties 


The U.S. Code § 4305 gives the president the authority to regulate or prohibit activities, such as transactions in foreign exchange, credits, and payments, imports and exports of gold or silver coin, bullion, currency, securities, and property transactions involving foreign countries or nationals, during the time of war for the safety and successful prosecution of the war. The president can suspend the provisions of this law if he finds it compatible with the safety of the United States and can also grant licenses to any person or class of persons to conduct such regulated activities.

The president can also require individuals to submit reports and records related to these transactions and, if necessary, seize any books of account, records, contracts, letters, etc. This law protects those who act in good faith in accordance with this law or any direction issued under it, from any liabilities in court. 

However, the president does not have the authority to regulate or prohibit the importation or exportation of any information or informational materials. This law also defines "United States" and "person" for its purposes. 

This section of the U.S. Code has been amended several times, with significant changes in 1994, 1988, and 1977. The amendments included adjustments to the president's authority and the types of materials exempted from prohibition or regulation.

Editorial Notes

References in Text
This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original “this Act”, meaning act Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 106, 40 Stat. 411, known as the Trading with the enemy Act, also known as the Trading with the Enemy Act, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see section 4301 of this title and Tables.

Codification
Section was formerly classified to section 6 of the former Appendix to this title prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.
Provisions that limited the salary of the alien property custodian to not more than $5,000 per annum have been omitted as obsolete and superseded. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89–554, Sept. 6, 1966, § 8(a), 80 Stat. 632, and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

Amendments
1988—Pub. L. 100–418 struck out before period at end “: Provided further, That the President shall cause a detailed report to be made to Congress on the first day of April of each year of all proceedings had under this chapter during the year preceding. Such report shall contain a list of all persons appointed or employed, with the salary or compensation paid to each, and a statement of the different kinds of property taken into custody and the disposition made thereof”.
1976—Pub. L. 94–273 substituted “April” for “January”.
1972—Pub. L. 92–310 struck out provisions which required the Alien Property Custodian to give a bond.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4306 -  Alien Property Custodian; general powers and duties 


This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the President to appoint an official known as the alien property custodian. This official is responsible for handling any money or property in the U.S. that belongs to an enemy, or an ally of an enemy, as defined by the provisions of the chapter. This includes receiving, administering, and accounting for such assets under the President's general direction.

In addition to the custodian, the President may also hire other necessary employees, such as clerks, attorneys, investigators, and accountants, to assist in the administration of this chapter. These employees must be appointed from eligible candidates supplied by the Civil Service Commission and in accordance with civil-service law.

Over time, several amendments and executive orders have modified the responsibilities and procedures associated with this position. These changes include the removal of a bond requirement for the custodian, the annual report submission to Congress, and the transfer of functions from the Alien Property Custodian to the Attorney General and then to the Secretary of the Treasury. 

Important events in the timeline of this legislation include the original act in 1917, the transfer of functions to the Attorney General in 1947, the transfer of jurisdiction to the Secretary of the Treasury in 1966, and various amendments in 1972, 1976, and 1988.

(a) Transmission of list to alien property custodian; report of property held on behalf of enemy

Every corporation incorporated within the United States, and every unincorporated association, or company, or trustee, or trustees within the United States, issuing shares or certificates representing beneficial interests, shall, under such rules and regulations as the President may prescribe and, within sixty days after October 6, 1917, and at such other times thereafter as the President may require, transmit to the alien property custodian a full list, duly sworn to, of every officer, director, or stockholder known to be, or whom the representative of such corporation, association, company, or trustee has reasonable cause to believe to be an enemy or ally of enemy resident within the territory, or a subject or citizen residing outside of the United States, of any nation with which the United States is at war, or resident within the territory, or a subject or citizen residing outside of the United States, of any ally of any nation with which the United States is at war, together with the amount of stock or shares owned by each such officer, director, or stockholder, or in which he has any interest.
The President may also require a similar list to be transmitted of all stock or shares owned on February third, nineteen hundred and seventeen, by any person now defined as an enemy or ally of enemy, or in which any such person had any interest; and he may also require a list to be transmitted of all cases in which said corporation, association, company, or trustee has reasonable cause to believe that the stock or shares on February third, nineteen hundred and seventeen, were owned or are owned by such enemy or ally of enemy, though standing on the books in the name of another: Provided, however, That the name of any such officer, director, or stockholder, shall be stricken permanently or temporarily from such list by the alien property custodian when he shall be satisfied that he is not such enemy or ally of enemy.
Any person in the United States who holds or has or shall hold or have custody or control of any property beneficial or otherwise, alone or jointly with others, of, for, or on behalf of an enemy or ally of enemy, or of any person whom he may have reasonable cause to believe to be an enemy or ally of enemy and any person in the United States who is or shall be indebted in any way to an enemy or ally of enemy, or to any person whom he may have reasonable cause to believe to be an enemy or ally of enemy, shall, with such exceptions and under such rules and regulations as the President shall prescribe, and within thirty days after October 6, 1917, or within thirty days after such property shall come within his custody or control, or after such debt shall become due, report the fact to the alien-property custodian by written statement under oath containing such particulars as said custodian shall require. The President may also require a similar report of all property so held, of, for, or on behalf of, and of all debts so owed to, any person now defined as an enemy or ally of enemy, on February third, nineteen hundred and seventeen: Provided, That the name of any person shall be stricken from the said report by the alien property custodian, either temporarily or permanently, when he shall be satisfied that such person is not an enemy or ally of enemy. The President may extend the time for filing the lists or reports required by this section for an additional period not exceeding ninety days.


(b) Acts constituting trade with enemy performed prior to October 6, 1917

Nothing in this chapter contained shall render valid or legal, or be construed to recognize as valid or legal, any act or transaction constituting trade with, to, from, for or on account of, or on behalf or for the benefit of an enemy performed or engaged in since the beginning of the war and prior to October 6, 1917, or any such act or transaction hereafter performed or engaged in except as authorized hereunder, which would otherwise have been or be void, illegal, or invalid at law. No conveyance, transfer, delivery, payment, or loan of money or other property, in violation of section 4303 of this title, made after October 6, 1917, and not under license as herein provided shall confer or create any right or remedy in respect thereof; and no person shall by virtue of any assignment, indorsement, or delivery to him of any debt, bill, note, or other obligation or chose in action by, from, or on behalf of, or on account of, or for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy have any right or remedy against the debtor, obligor, or other person liable to pay, fulfill, or perform the same unless said assignment, indorsement, or delivery was made prior to the beginning of the war or shall be made under license as herein provided, or unless, if made after the beginning of the war and prior to October 6, 1917, the person to whom the same was made shall prove lack of knowledge and of reasonable cause to believe on his part that the same was made by, from or on behalf of, or on account of, or for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy; and any person who knowingly pays, discharges, or satisfies any such debt, note, bill, or other obligation or chose in action shall, on conviction thereof, be deemed to violate section 4303 of this title: Provided, That nothing in this chapter contained shall prevent the carrying out, completion, or performance of any contract, agreement, or obligation originally made with or entered into by an enemy or ally of enemy where, prior to the beginning of the war and not in contemplation thereof, the interest of such enemy or ally of enemy devolved by assignment or otherwise upon a person not an enemy or ally of enemy, and no enemy or ally of enemy will be benefited by such carrying out, completion, or performance otherwise than by release from obligation thereunder.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent payment of money belonging or owing to an enemy or ally of enemy to a person within the United States not an enemy or ally of enemy, for the benefit of such person or of any other person within the United States, not an enemy or ally of enemy, if the funds so paid shall have been received prior to the beginning of the war and such payments arise out of transactions entered into prior to the beginning of the war, and not in contemplation thereof: Provided, That such payment shall not be made without the license of the President, general or special, as provided in this chapter.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to authorize the prosecution of any suit or action at law or in equity in any court within the United States by an enemy or ally of enemy prior to the end of the war, except as provided in section 4310 of this title: Provided, however, That an enemy or ally of enemy licensed to do business under this chapter may prosecute and maintain any such suit or action so far as the same arises solely out of the business transacted within the United States under such license and so long as such license remains in full force and effect: And provided further, That an enemy or ally of enemy may defend by counsel any suit in equity or action at law which may be brought against him.
Receipt of notice from the President to the effect that he has reasonable ground to believe that any person is an enemy or ally of enemy shall be prima facie defense to any one receiving the same, in any suit or action at law or in equity brought or maintained, or to any right or set-off or recoupment asserted by, such person and based on failure to complete or perform since the beginning of the war any contract or other obligation. In any prosecution under section 4315 of this title proof of receipt of notice from the President to the effect that he has reasonable cause to believe that any person is an enemy or ally of enemy shall be prima facie evidence that the person receiving such notice has reasonable cause to believe such other person to be an enemy or ally of enemy within the meaning of section 4303 of this title.


(c) Conveyance, transfer, assignment, delivery, or payment over to alien property custodian; seizure by alien property custodian

If the President shall so require any money or other property including (but not thereby limiting the generality of the above) patents, copyrights, applications therefor, and rights to apply for the same, trade marks, choses in action, and rights and claims of every character and description owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, an enemy or ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine is so owning or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or the same may be seized by the Alien Property Custodian; and all property thus acquired shall be held, administered and disposed of as elsewhere provided in this chapter.
Any requirement made pursuant to this chapter, or a duly certified copy thereof, may be filed, registered, or recorded in any office for the filing, registering, or recording of conveyances, transfers, or assignments of any such property or rights as may be covered by such requirement (including the proper office for filing, registering, or recording conveyances, transfers, or assignments of patents, copyrights, trade-marks, or any rights therein or any other rights); and if so filed, registered, or recorded shall impart the same notice and have the same force and effect as a duly executed conveyance, transfer, or assignment to the Alien Property Custodian so filed, registered, or recorded.
Whenever any such property shall consist of shares of stock or other beneficial interest in any corporation, association, or company or trust, it shall be the duty of the corporation, association, or company or trustee or trustees issuing such shares or any certificates or other instruments representing the same or any other beneficial interest to cancel upon its, his, or their books all shares of stock or other beneficial interest standing upon its, his, or their books in the name of any person or persons, or held for, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of any person or persons who shall have been determined by the President, after investigation, to be an enemy or ally of enemy, and which shall have been required to be conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him, and in lieu thereof to issue certificates or other instruments for such shares or other beneficial interest to the Alien Property Custodian or otherwise, as the Alien Property Custodian shall require.
The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any money or other property heretofore or hereafter conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or required so to be, or seized by him shall be that provided by the terms of this chapter, and in the event of sale or other disposition of such property by the Alien Property Custodian, shall be limited to and enforced against the net proceeds received therefrom and held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.


(d) Voluntary payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery by holder not an enemy

If not required to pay, convey, transfer, assign, or deliver under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, any person not an enemy or ally of enemy who owes to, or holds for, or on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of an enemy or of an ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President hereunder, any money or other property, or to whom any obligation or form of liability to such enemy or ally of enemy is presented for payment, may, at his option, with the consent of the President, pay, convey, transfer, assign, or deliver to the alien property custodian said money or other property under such rules and regulations as the President shall prescribe.


(e) Acts or omissions under order, rule, or regulation; acquittance and discharge of obligations; certificate of authority

No person shall be held liable in any court for or in respect to anything done or omitted in pursuance of any order, rule, or regulation made by the President under the authority of this chapter.
Any payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery of money or property made to the alien property custodian hereunder shall be a full acquittance and discharge for all purposes of the obligation of the person making the same to the extent of same. The alien property custodian and such other persons as the President may appoint shall have power to execute, acknowledge, and deliver any such instrument or instruments as may be necessary or proper to evidence upon the record or otherwise such acquittance and discharge, and shall, in case of payment to the alien property custodian of any debt or obligation owed to an enemy or ally of enemy, deliver up any notes, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness or obligation, or any security therefor in which such enemy or ally of enemy had any right or interest that may have come into the possession of the alien property custodian, with like effect as if he or they, respectively, were duly appointed by the enemy or ally of enemy, creditor, or obligee. The President shall issue to every person so appointed a certificate of the appointment and authority of such person, and such certificate shall be received in evidence in all courts within the United States. Whenever any such certificate of authority shall be offered to any registrar, clerk, or other recording officer, Federal or otherwise, within the United States, such officer shall record the same in like manner as a power of attorney, and such record or a duly certified copy thereof shall be received in evidence in all courts of the United States or other courts within the United States.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4307 -  Lists of enemy or ally of enemy officers, directors or stockholders of corporations in United States; acts constituting trade with enemy prior to October 6, 1917; conveyance of property to custodian; voluntary payment to custodian by holder; acts under order, rule, or regulation 


The U.S. Code § 4307 pertains to how corporations and other entities within the United States must report and disclose information about individuals who may be considered enemies or allies of enemies, especially during times of war. These individuals could be officers, directors, or stockholders of the corporations. 

Under subsection A, corporations are required to provide sworn lists of such individuals, along with the details of the stocks or shares they own, to the alien property custodian. This should be done within 60 days after the start of the war, and at other times as prescribed by the President. The President can also demand lists of stocks owned by such individuals prior to the war, and information about cases where the corporation believes stocks are/were owned by an enemy or ally of enemy.

Subsection B states that no act or transaction constituting trade with an enemy, performed before or after the start of war, is considered valid or legal unless authorized under this chapter. Also, no payments or property transfers in violation of this section shall confer any legal rights.

Under subsection C, the President has the power to require any money or other property, belonging to or held for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy, to be handed over to the alien property custodian. The alien property custodian then administers and disposes of this property. 

Essentially, this law requires corporations and other entities to keep track of, and report on, interests held by potential enemies or allies of enemies, and allows the government to seize assets from these individuals if deemed necessary. This law was particularly relevant during World War I and II when the U.S. was at war with several countries.

(a) In general

Any person not an enemy or ally of enemy claiming any interest, right, or title in any money or other property which may have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, or to whom any debt may be owing from an enemy or ally of enemy whose property or any part thereof shall have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States may file with the said custodian a notice of his claim under oath and in such form and containing such particulars as the said custodian shall require; and the President, if application is made therefor by the claimant, may order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States, or of the interest therein to which the President shall determine said claimant is entitled: Provided, That no such order by the President shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the claimant to establish any right, title, or interest which he may have in such money or other property. If the President shall not so order within sixty days after the filing of such application or if the claimant shall have filed the notice as above required and shall have made no application to the President, said claimant may institute a suit in equity in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which such claimant resides, or, if a corporation, where it has its principal place of business (to which suit the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may be, shall be made a party defendant), to establish the interest, right, title, or debt so claimed, and if so established the court shall order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States or the interest therein to which the court shall determine said claimant is entitled. If suit shall be so instituted, then such money or property shall be retained in the custody of the Alien Property Custodian, or in the Treasury of the United States, as provided in this chapter, and until any final judgment or decree which shall be entered in favor of the claimant shall be fully satisfied by payment or conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery by the defendant, or by the Alien Property Custodian, or Treasurer of the United States on order of the court, or until final judgment or decree shall be entered against the claimant or suit otherwise terminated: Provided further, That upon a determination made by the President, in time of war or during any national emergency declared by the President, that the interest and welfare of the United States require the sale of any property or interest or any part thereof claimed in any suit filed under this subsection and pending on or after October 22, 1962, the Alien Property Custodian or any successor officer, or agency may sell such property or interest or part thereof, in conformity with law applicable to sales of property by him, at any time prior to the entry of final judgment in such suit. No such sale shall be made until thirty days have passed after the publication of notice in the Federal Register of the intention to sell. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be deposited in a special account established in the Treasury, and shall be held in trust by the Secretary of the Treasury pending the entry of final judgment in such suit. Any recovery of any claimant in any such suit in respect of the property or interest or part thereof so sold shall be satisfied from the net proceeds of such sale unless such claimant, within sixty days after receipt of notice of the amount of net proceeds of sale serves upon the Alien Property Custodian, or any successor officer or agency, and files with the court an election to waive all claims to the net proceeds, or any part thereof, and to claim just compensation instead. If the court finds that the claimant has established an interest, right, or title in any property in respect of which such an election has been served and filed, it shall proceed to determine the amount which will constitute just compensation for such interest, right, or title, and shall order payment to the claimant of the amount so determined. An order for the payment of just compensation hereunder shall be a judgment against the United States and shall be payable first from the net proceeds of the sale in an amount not to exceed the amount the claimant would have received had he elected to accept his proportionate part of the net proceeds of the sale, and the balance, if any, shall be payable in the same manner as are judgments in cases arising under section 1346 of title 28. The Alien Property Custodian or any successor officer or agency shall, immediately upon the entry of final judgment, notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the determination by final judgment of the claimant’s interest and right to the proportionate part of the net proceeds from the sale, and the final determination by judgment of the amount of just compensation in the event the claimant has elected to recover just compensation for the interest in the property he claimed.

If such partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, would have been entitled to the return of its money or other property only upon filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), then the successor shall be entitled to the return under this subsection only upon filing such written consent.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4309 -  Claims to property transferred to custodian; notice of claim; filing; return of property; suits to recover; sale of claimed property in time of war or during national emergency 


This section of the U.S. Code deals with claims to property that has been transferred to the Alien Property Custodian during times of war or national emergency. It outlines the process by which non-enemy individuals can file claims for these properties and the circumstances under which these properties may be returned.

The process for filing a claim requires the claimant to file a notice under oath, in a form specified by the Alien Property Custodian. The President has the authority to order the return of the property if the claimant applies for it. If the President does not order the return within 60 days, the claimant can file a lawsuit to establish their claim.

In cases where the claimant has filed a lawsuit, the property is to be retained by the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasury until the final judgment is satisfied. The President also has the authority to order the sale of claimed property during times of war or national emergency, with the proceeds held in trust by the Treasury until the final judgment. If a claimant's recovery is satisfied by the net proceeds of a sale, they have the option to waive their claims to the proceeds and instead claim just compensation.

The code also details conditions under which the President may order the return of property to certain individuals, entities, or governments. These include circumstances where the original owner was not a citizen or subject of an enemy state, or was a citizen of a neutral or allied country. In each case, the President has the discretion to determine ownership and order the return of the property.

(c)
 Any citizen of the United States or any corporation organized within the United States desiring to manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, a machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or design, or to carry on, or to use any trade-mark, print, label or cause to be carried on, a process under any patent or copyrighted matter owned or controlled by an enemy or ally of enemy at any time during the existence of a state of war may apply to the President for a license; and the President is authorized to grant such a license, nonexclusive or exclusive as he shall deem best, provided he shall be of the opinion that such grant is for the public welfare, and that the applicant is able and intends in good faith to manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, the machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or design, or to carry on, or cause to be carried on, the process or to use the trade-mark, print, label or copyrighted matter. The President may prescribe the conditions of this license, including the fixing of prices of articles and products necessary to the health of the military and naval forces of the United States or the successful prosecution of the war, and the rules and regulations under which such license may be granted and the fee which shall be charged therefor, not exceeding $100, and not exceeding one per centum of the fund deposited as hereinafter provided. Such license shall be a complete defense to any suit at law or in equity instituted by the enemy or ally of enemy owners of the letters patent, trade-mark, print, label or copyright, or otherwise, against the licensee for infringement or for damages, royalty, or other money award on account of anything done by the licensee under such license, except as provided in subsection (f) hereof.

Upon violation by the licensee of any of the provisions of this chapter, or of the conditions of the license, the President may, after due notice and hearing, cancel any license granted by him.

(f)
 The owner of any patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright under which a license is granted hereunder may, after the end of the war and until the expiration of one year thereafter, file a bill in equity against the licensee in the district court of the United States for the district in which the said licensee resides, or, if a corporation, in which it has its principal place of business (to which suit the Treasurer of the United States shall be made a party), for recovery from the said licensee for all use and enjoyment of the said patented invention, trade-mark, print, label, or copyrighted matter: Provided, however, That whenever suit is brought, as above, notice shall be filed with the alien property custodian within thirty days after date of entry of suit: Provided further, That the licensee may make any and all defenses which would be available were no license granted.

If no suit is brought within one year after the end of the war, or no notice is filed as above required, then the licensee shall not be liable to make any further deposits, and all funds deposited by him shall be repaid to him on order of the alien property custodian. Upon entry of suit and notice filed as above required, or upon repayment of funds as above provided, the liability of the licensee to make further reports to the President shall cease.If suit is brought as above provided, the court may, at any time, terminate the license, and may, in such event, issue an injunction to restrain the licensee from infringement thereafter, or the court, in case the licensee, prior to suit, shall have made investment of capital based on possession of the license, may continue the license for such period and upon such terms and with such royalties as it shall find to be just and reasonable.
In the case of any such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright, conveyed, assigned, transferred, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him, any suit brought under this subsection, within the time limited therein, shall be considered as having been brought by the owner within the meaning of this subsection, in so far as such suit relates to royalties for the period prior to the sale by the Alien Property Custodian of such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright, if brought either by the Alien Property Custodian or by the person who was the owner thereof immediately prior to the date such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright was seized or otherwise acquired by the Alien Property Custodian.


(g)
 Any enemy, or ally of enemy, may institute and prosecute suits in equity against any person other than a licensee under this chapter to enjoin infringement of letters patent, trade-mark, print, label, and copyrights in the United States owned or controlled by said enemy or ally of enemy, in the same manner and to the extent that he would be entitled so to do if the United States was not at war: Provided, That no final judgment or decree shall be entered in favor of such enemy or ally of enemy by any court except after thirty days’ notice to the alien property custodian.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4310 -  Acts permitted; applications for patents, or registration of trade-marks or copyrights; payment of tax in relation thereto; licenses under enemy owned patent or copyright; statements by licensees; term and cancellation; suits against licensees; restraining infringements; powers of attorney; keeping secret inventions 


The United States Code, Title 50, Section 4310, outlines certain activities that are permitted in relation to patents, copyrights, and trademarks during a state of war, particularly concerning enemies or allies of enemies. 

The code permits U.S. citizens or corporations to pay any required fees related to patents and trademarks to an enemy or ally of enemy nation, subject to presidential authorization. It also allows for the filing and prosecution of patent or copyright applications in such countries, but only after obtaining a license from the President.

The law also allows U.S. citizens or corporations to manufacture items or use trademarks protected by patents or copyrights owned or controlled by an enemy or ally of an enemy, provided they obtain a license from the President. 

Should a licensee violate any of the provisions or conditions of the license, the President has the authority to cancel the license after due notice and hearing. The licensee is also obligated to pay a certain percentage of their gross revenue from the sale of the patented item or use of the trademark to the Alien Property Custodian, who will then deposit it in the Treasury of the United States as a trust fund.

The law also gives the enemy or ally of enemy, the right to file lawsuits to prevent infringements of their patents or copyrights. However, no final judgment can be made in favor of such an enemy without a 30-day notice to the alien property custodian.

The President also has the authority to order that an invention be kept secret and withhold the grant of a patent if it is believed that its publication could be detrimental to public safety or defense, or assist the enemy.

This is a law that seeks to balance the need for military and economic security during times of war with respect for intellectual property rights, even those held by enemies or their allies.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4311 -  Importations prohibited 


This federal law, originally passed in 1917 during World War I, grants the President of the United States the authority to ban imports from any foreign country during a time of war if they determine it's necessary for public safety. The President has the power to specify the articles of import that are banned and can set conditions for exceptions. However, this law also stipulates that no preference can be given to the ports of one state over another. The law remains in effect until the President or Congress says otherwise. 

In simple terms, this law allows the President to ban certain imports during war for safety reasons, but doesn't allow the President to play favorites among U.S. states.

Historically, this law would have been relevant during both World Wars and may still be used in the event of future conflict. Its original implementation in 1917 aligns with the U.S.'s entry into World War I. This law could have counterparts in other nations with similar laws regarding importation during times of war.

All moneys (including checks and drafts payable on demand) paid to or received by the alien property custodian pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited forthwith in the Treasury of the United States, and may be invested and reinvested by the Secretary of the Treasury in United States bonds or United States certificates of indebtedness, under such rules and regulations as the President shall prescribe for such deposit, investment, and sale of securities; and as soon after the end of the war as the President shall deem practicable, such securities shall be sold and the proceeds deposited in the Treasury.
All other property of an enemy, or ally of enemy, conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the alien property custodian hereunder shall be safely held and administered by him except as hereinafter provided; and the President is authorized to designate as a depositary, or depositaries, of property of an enemy or ally of enemy, any bank, or banks, or trust company, or trust companies, or other suitable depositary or depositaries, located and doing business in the United States. The alien property custodian may deposit with such designated depositary or depositaries, or with the Secretary of the Treasury, any stocks, bonds, notes, time drafts, time bills of exchange, or other securities, or property (except money or checks or drafts payable on demand which are required to be deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury) and such depositary or depositaries shall be authorized and empowered to collect any dividends or interest or income that may become due and any maturing obligations held for the account of such custodian. Any moneys collected on said account shall be paid and deposited forthwith by said depositary or by the alien property custodian into the Treasury of the United States as hereinbefore provided.
The President shall require all such designated depositaries to execute and file bonds sufficient in his judgment to protect property on deposit, such bonds to be conditioned as he may direct.
The alien property custodian shall be vested with all of the powers of a common-law trustee in respect of all property, other than money, which has been or shall be, or which has been or shall be required to be, conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to him in pursuance of the provisions of this chapter, and, in addition thereto, acting under the supervision and direction of the President, and under such rules and regulations as the President shall prescribe, shall have power to manage such property and do any act or things in respect thereof or make any disposition thereof or of any part thereof, by sale or otherwise, and exercise any rights or powers which may be or become appurtenant thereto or to the ownership thereof in like manner as though he were the absolute owner thereof: Provided, That any property sold under this chapter except when sold to the United States, shall be sold only to American citizens, at public sale to the highest bidder, after public advertisement of time and place of sale which shall be where the property or a major portion thereof is situated, unless the President stating the reasons therefor, in the public interest shall otherwise determine: Provided further, That when sold at public sale, the alien property custodian upon the order of the President stating the reasons therefor, shall have the right to reject all bids and resell such property at public sale or otherwise as the President may direct. Any person purchasing property from the alien property custodian for an undisclosed principal, or for re-sale to a person not a citizen of the United States, or for the benefit of a person not a citizen of the United States, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both, and the property shall be forfeited to the United States. It shall be the duty of every corporation incorporated within the United States and every unincorporated association, or company, or trustee, or trustees within the United States issuing shares or certificates representing beneficial interests to transfer such shares or certificates upon its, his, or their books into the name of the alien property custodian upon demand, accompanied by the presentation of the certificates which represent such shares or beneficial interests. The alien property custodian shall forthwith deposit in the Treasury of the United States, as hereinbefore provided, the proceeds of any such property or rights so sold by him.
Any money or property required or authorized by the provisions of this chapter to be paid, conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the alien property custodian shall, if said custodian shall so direct by written order, be paid, conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Treasurer of the United States with the same effect as if to the alien property custodian.
After the end of the war any claim of any enemy or of an ally of enemy to any money or other property received and held by the alien property custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury, shall be settled as Congress shall direct: Provided, however, That on order of the President as set forth in section 4309 of this title, or of the court, as set forth in sections 4309 and 4310 of this title, the alien property custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may be, shall forthwith convey, transfer, assign, and pay to the person to whom the President shall so order, or in whose behalf the court shall enter final judgment or decree, any property of an enemy or ally of enemy held by said custodian or by said Treasurer, so far as may be necessary to comply with said order of the President or said final judgment or decree of the court: And provided further, That the Treasurer of the United States, on order of the alien property custodian shall, as provided in section 4310 of this title, repay to the licensee any funds deposited by said licensee.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4312 -  Property transferred to Alien Property Custodian 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the rules and regulations for property that is transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, an office that was established during World War I to handle property within the United States that belonged to nations at war with the U.S. 

The code stipulates that all money received by the custodian should be deposited into the U.S. Treasury and can be invested in U.S. bonds or certificates of indebtedness. It also specifies that other types of property should be securely held and managed by the custodian. The President may designate banks or trust companies to serve as depositories for such property. 

The custodian has the authority to manage such property and to sell it under the rules set by the President, provided that it is only sold to American citizens. Unauthorized sale of this property, especially to non-U.S. citizens, is deemed a criminal offense, punishable by fine or imprisonment, and the property would be forfeited to the U.S. 

At the end of a war, any claims by an enemy or ally of an enemy to any money or property held by the custodian is to be settled as directed by Congress.  

This law was amended in 1918 to include the public sale provision and penalties for violation of sale regulations. It was transferred to the Attorney General in 1947.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4313 -  Statements by masters of vessels and owners of cargoes before granting clearances 


This statute requires the master or person in charge of a vessel, before its departure from port, to deliver a statement, verified under oath to the collector of customs, stating that the cargo is not shipped or to be delivered in violation of this chapter. The owners, shippers or consignors of the cargo are also required to provide a similar statement under oath. This statement should also include the names and addresses of the actual recipients of the cargo. If the shipment is made to a bank or other broker, factor, or agent, the names and addresses of the persons who are the actual consignees on whose account the shipment is made should also be included. The master or person in control of the vessel is required to deliver a copy of the manifest and the said statement to the American consular officer of the district in which the cargo is unloaded upon reaching the port of destination of any of the cargo. 

This law was put into place during times of war and is a part of measures to prevent trading with the enemy. The statute references earlier laws and amendments pertaining to shipping and customs procedures. The collector of customs role, mentioned in the law, has been transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury as per Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1965.

The collector of customs shall, during the present war, in each case report to the President the amount of gold or silver coin or bullion or other moneys of the United States contained in any cargo intended for export. Such report shall include the names and addresses of the consignors and consignees, together with any facts known to the collector with reference to such shipment and particularly those which may indicate that such gold or silver coin or bullion or moneys of the United States may be intended for delivery or may be delivered, directly or indirectly, to an enemy or an ally of enemy.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4314 -  False manifest; refusal of clearance; reports of gold or silver coin in cargoes for export 


This U.S. code section gives authority to the collector of customs during times of war to refuse clearance for departure from a U.S. port to any vessel, whether domestic or foreign, if there is reasonable belief that the cargo manifest or additional statements are false, or if the vessel is suspected to be carrying property of, or for, an enemy or ally of an enemy. The same authority applies if any property or person on board is being exported, taken out, or transported in violation of the law. 

Additionally, the collector of customs is required to report to the President the amount of U.S. gold or silver coins, bullion, or other money contained in any cargo intended for export. This report must include the names and addresses of the consignors and consignees, and any known facts about the shipment, particularly those that might indicate the cargo may be intended for delivery to an enemy or ally of an enemy. 

The code also notes the abolishment of the offices of collector of customs, comptroller of customs, surveyor of customs, and appraiser of merchandise in the Bureau of Customs of the Department of the Treasury by December 31, 1966, with their functions transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury.

Amendments
2010—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 111–195 substituted “if a natural person, be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.” for “if a natural person, be fined not more than $100,000, or imprisoned for not more than ten years or both; and the officer, director, or agent of any corporation who knowingly participates in such violation shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned for not more than ten years or both.”
1996—Pub. L. 104–114, § 102(d)(3)(A), made technical amendment inserting section designation in original.
Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 104–114, § 102(d)(3)(B), substituted “participates” for “participants”.
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 104–114, § 102(d)(1), amended subsec. (b), as added by Pub. L. 102–484, generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows:
“(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may impose a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 on any person who violates any license, order, rule, or regulation issued under this chapter.
“(2) Any property, funds, securities, papers, or other articles or documents, or any vessel, together with its tackle, apparel, furniture, and equipment, that is the subject of a violation under paragraph (1) shall, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, be forfeited to the United States Government.
“(3) The penalties provided under this subsection may not be imposed for—
“(A) news gathering, research, or the export or import of, or transmission of, information or informational materials; or
“(B) clearly defined educational or religious activities, or activities of recognized human rights organizations, that are reasonably limited in frequency, duration, and number of participants.
“(4) The penalties provided under this subsection may be imposed only on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing in accordance with sections 554 through 557 of title 5, with the right to prehearing discovery.
“(5) Judicial review of any penalty imposed under this subsection may be had to the extent provided in section 702 of title 5.”
Pub. L. 104–114, § 102(d)(2), struck out subsec. (b), as added by Pub. L. 102–393, which read as follows:
“(b)(1) A civil penalty of not to exceed $50,000 may be imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury on any person who violates any license, order, rule, or regulation issued in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
“(2) The penalties provided under this subsection may not be imposed for—
“(A) news gathering, research, or the export or import of, or transmission of, information or informational materials; or
“(B) clearly defined educational or religious activities, or activities of recognized human rights organizations, that are reasonably limited in frequency, duration, and number of participants.”
1992—Pub. L. 102–484, which directed substitution of “(a) Whoever” for “That whoever” and addition of subsec. (b) at end, was executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress in light of the intervening general amendment by Pub. L. 102–393 (see below), by adding subsec. (b) after subsec. (a).
Pub. L. 102–393 amended section generally, substituting subsecs. (a) to (c) for former undesignated provisions which read as follows: “Whoever shall willfully violate any of the provisions of this chapter or of any license, rule, or regulation issued thereunder, and whoever shall willfully violate, neglect, or refuse to comply with any order of the President issued in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $50,000, or, if a natural person, imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both; and the officer, director, or agent of any corporation who knowingly participates in such violation shall be punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both, and any property, funds, securities, papers, or other articles or documents, or any vessel, together with her tackle, apparel, furniture, and equipment, concerned in such violation shall be forfeited to the United States.”

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4315 -  Offenses; punishment; forfeitures of property 


This section of the U.S. Code, titled "Offenses; punishment; forfeitures of property," is part of the Trading with the Enemy Act and outlines criminal and civil penalties for violating the provisions of the act or any license, rule, or regulation issued under it. 

Criminal penalties can include a fine of up to $1,000,000 or imprisonment for up to 20 years (or both), with civil penalties of up to $50,000. Any property involved in the violation may also be forfeited to the U.S. Government. The penalties can only be imposed after the opportunity for an agency hearing, with the right to prehearing discovery.

No property or interest or proceeds shall be returned under this chapter, nor shall any payment be made or judgment awarded in respect of any property or interest vested in or transferred to any officer or agency of the United States under this chapter unless satisfactory evidence is furnished to the President or such officer or agency as he may designate, or the court, as the case may be, that the aggregate of the fees to be paid to all agents, attorneys at law or in fact, or representatives, for services rendered in connection with such return or payment or judgment does not exceed 10 per centum of the value of such property or interest or proceeds or of such payment. Any agent, attorney at law or in fact, or representative, believing that the aggregate of the fees should be in excess of such 10 per centum may in the case of any return of, or the making of any payment in respect of, such property or interest or proceeds by the President or such officer or agency as he may designate, petition the district court of the United States for the district in which he resides for an order authorizing fees in excess of 10 per centum and shall name such officer or agency as respondent. The court hearing such petition, or a court awarding any judgment in respect of any such property or interest or proceeds, as the case may be, shall approve an aggregate of fees in excess of 10 per centum of the value of such property or interest or proceeds only upon a finding that there exist special circumstances of unusual hardship which require the payment of such excess. Any person accepting any fee in excess of an amount approved hereunder, or retaining for more than thirty days any portion of a fee, accepted prior to approval hereunder, in excess of the fee as approved, shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4317 -  Fees of agents, attorneys, or representatives 


This section of the U.S. Code addresses the fees charged by agents, attorneys, or representatives in cases involving the return or payment of property or interests vested in or transferred to an officer or agency of the United States under this chapter. The fees must not exceed 10% of the value of the property or interest unless there exist special circumstances of unusual hardship. Those seeking to charge more than this 10% cap may petition a U.S. district court for authorization. Anyone who accepts a fee in excess of the approved amount, or retains an unapproved fee for more than 30 days, is in violation of this chapter. 

Over the years, amendments have been made to this section, such as the 1946 amendment that raised the fee limitation from 3% to 10%, and the 1928 amendment that added "at law or in fact" after "attorney."

The Alien Property Custodian has been designated as the officer to administer the powers conferred on the President by this section. The Attorney General took over the powers, duties, and functions of the now-terminated Office of World War II Alien Property Custodian.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4318 -  Claims of naturalized citizens as affected by expatriation 


This section of the U.S. Code specifies that a naturalized U.S. citizen's claim under the relevant chapter should not be denied based on any presumption of expatriation. The mentioned expatriation refers to a law approved in 1907 which could be used to presume a citizen's renunciation of their U.S. citizenship. However, this section stipulates that if the citizen can provide satisfactory evidence of their uninterrupted loyalty to the U.S. and that they have returned to the country (or intended to return but were unable due to situations beyond their control), their claim cannot be denied on the basis of the presumption of expatriation.

In simpler terms, this section is functioning as a legal safeguard for naturalized U.S. citizens, allowing them to maintain their claims despite potential assumptions about their expatriation. The section was added to the chapter in 1923, and is a part of the Trading with the enemy Act. This law was formerly classified differently but has been renumbered and reclassified for editorial purposes.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4319 -  Fugitives from justice barred from recovery 


This U.S. Code provision, first enacted in 1917 and then revised in 1923 and 1928, states that anyone who is a fugitive from justice in the United States, including any state, territory or the District of Columbia, is not entitled to the return of any property or money under any provision of this chapter or any amendment of this chapter.

In layman's terms, if you're on the run from the law, you can't claim any property or money under the laws outlined in this particular chapter of the U.S. Code, which is known as the Trading with the Enemy Act.

The 1928 amendment specifically included any amendments to the chapter in the provision, reinforcing that the same rules apply regardless of any changes made to the original law. 

Essentially, the law is saying that if you're a fugitive, you're forfeiting certain rights to property and money under this specific set of laws.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4320 -  Payment of income, etc., by Alien Property Custodian 


This U.S. Code mandates the Alien Property Custodian to pay the net income, including dividends, interest, annuities, and other earnings, accrued from any money or property held in trust for the rightful person. The Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States must do this on behalf of the Alien Property Custodian. The President may determine the rules and regulations for these payments. 

This law was initiated on March 4, 1923, and was later amended in 1928 to remove the restriction that no person can be paid more than $10,000 per annum. 

The Alien Property Custodian and the Office of Alien Property Custodian's functions were transferred to the Attorney General in 1947 as per the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1947. 

In simpler terms, if a foreign individual's property had been seized or taken control of by the U.S government, the law ensures that the income from this property is paid to the person it rightfully belongs to. The exact regulations regarding these payments are determined by the President. Initially, there was a cap on how much could be paid out per year, but this has since been removed. The responsibility of managing these matters is now with the Attorney General.

(a) Authority to pay taxes and expenses; disallowance of claims by enemy; limitation on claims for recovery of deductions for expenses

The Alien Property Custodian is authorized to pay all taxes (including special assessments), heretofore or hereafter lawfully assessed by any body politic against any money or other property held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States under this chapter, and to pay the necessary expenses incurred by him or by any depositary for him in securing the possession, collection, or control of any such money or other property, or in protecting or administering the same. Such taxes and expenses shall be paid out of the money or other property against which such taxes are assessed or in respect of which such expenses are incurred, or (if such money or other property is insufficient) out of any other money or property held for the same person, notwithstanding the fact that a claim may have been filed or suit instituted under this chapter. No claim shall be filed with the Alien Property Custodian or allowed by him or by the President of the United States, nor shall any suit be instituted or maintained against the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, or the United States, under any provisions of law, by any person who was an enemy or ally of enemy as defined in this chapter, and no allowance of any such claim now pending shall be made, nor judgment entered in any such suit heretofore or hereafter instituted, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions, heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties, or income therefrom, held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for the general or administrative expenses of the office of the Alien Property Custodian, which deduction or deductions on the collection of any income do not exceed the sum of two per centum of such income or which on the return of any moneys or properties or income therefrom, do not exceed the sum of two per centum of the aggregate value thereof at the time or times as nearly as may be, of such deduction or deductions, or, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties or income therefrom held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for any and all necessary expenses incurred and actually disbursed by the Alien Property Custodian or by any depositary for him in securing the possession, collection or control of any such money or properties or income therefrom, or in protecting or administering the same, as said general or administrative and other expenses and said aggregate value of returned money or properties or income therefrom have been heretofore or shall be hereafter determined by said Alien Property Custodian.


(b) Income, war-profits, excess-profits, or estate taxes; computation of amount; payment

In the case of income, war-profits, excess-profits, or estate taxes imposed by any Act of Congress, the amount thereof shall, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be computed in the same manner (except as hereinafter in this section provided) as though the money or other property had not been seized by or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid, as far as practicable, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. Pending final determination of the tax liability the Alien Property Custodian is authorized to return, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, money or other property in any trust in such amounts as may be determined, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be consistent with the prompt payment of the full amount of the internal-revenue taxes. Notwithstanding the expiration of any period of limitation provided by law, credit or refund of any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected may be made or allowed if claim therefor was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Alien Property Custodian on or before February 15, 1933.


(c) Capital gains

So much of the net income of a taxpayer for the taxable year 1917, or any succeeding taxable year, as represents the gain derived from the sale or exchange by the Alien Property Custodian of any property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to him, or seized by him, may at the option of the taxpayer be segregated from the net income and separately taxed at the rate of 30 per centum. This subsection shall be applied and the amount of net income to be so segregated shall be determined, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, as nearly as may be in the same manner as provided in section 208 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (relating to capital net gains), but without regard to the period for which the property was held by the Alien Property Custodian before its sale or exchange, and whether or not the taxpayer is an individual.


(d) Sales or exchanges of property; involuntary conversion

Any property sold or exchanged by the Alien Property Custodian (whether before or after March 10, 1928) shall be considered as having been compulsorily or involuntarily converted, within the meaning of the income, excess-profits, and war-profits tax laws and regulations; and the provisions of such laws and regulations relating to such a conversion shall (under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury) apply in the case of the proceeds of such sale or exchange. For the purpose of determining whether the proceeds of such conversion have been expended within such time as will entitle the taxpayer to the benefits of such laws and regulations relating to such a conversion, the date of the return of the proceeds to the person entitled thereto shall be considered as the date of the conversion.


(e) Interest or civil penalty

In case of any internal-revenue tax imposed in respect of property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, or seized by him, and imposed in respect of any period (in the taxable year 1917 or any succeeding taxable year) during which such property was held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, no interest or civil penalty shall be assessed upon, collected from, or paid by or on behalf of, the taxpayer; nor shall any interest be credited or paid to the taxpayer in respect of any credit or refund allowed or made in respect of such tax.


(f) Period of limitations

The benefits of subsections (c), (d), and (e) shall be extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, or before the expiration of six months after March 10, 1928, whichever date is the later. The benefits of subsection (d) shall also be extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of six months after the return of the proceeds.

(a) Authority to invest; limitation on amount; credit against investment
(1)
 The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed to invest, from time to time upon the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, out of the funds held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States for the Alien Property Custodian, an amount not to exceed $40,000,000 in the aggregate, in one or more participating certificates issued by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(2)
 When in the case of any trust written consent under subsection (m) of section 4309 of this title has been filed, an amount equal to the portion of such trust the return of which is temporarily postponed under such subsection shall be credited against the investment made under paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the total amount so credited is in excess of the amount invested under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the excess shall be invested by the Alien Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, without regard to the $40,000,000 limitation in paragraph (1). If the amount invested under paragraph (1) of this subsection is in excess of the total amount so credited, such excess shall, from time to time on request of the Alien Property Custodian, be paid to him out of the funds in the German special deposit account created by section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, and such payments shall have priority over any payments therefrom other than the payments under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of such section (relating to expenses of administration).


(b) Investments out of unallocated interest fundThe Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed to invest, in one or more participating certificates issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, out of the unallocated interest fund, as defined in section 4325 of this title—
(1)
 The sum of $25,000,000. If, after the allocation under section 4323 of this title has been made, the amount of the unallocated interest fund allocated to the trust described in subsection (c) of such section is found to be in excess of $25,000,000, such excess shall be invested by the Alien Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. If the amount so allocated is found to be less than $25,000,000 any participating certificate or certificates that have been issued shall be corrected accordingly; and

(2)
 The balance of such unallocated interest fund remaining after the investment provided for in paragraph (1) and the payment of allocated earnings in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 4323 of this title have been made.


(c) Insufficiency of amount; payment out of German special deposit account

If the amount of such unallocated interest fund, remaining after the investment required by paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section has been made, is insufficient to pay the allocated earnings in accordance with subsection (b) of section 4323 of this title, then the amount necessary to make up the deficiency shall be paid out of the funds in the German special deposit account created by section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, and such payment shall have priority over any payments therefrom other than the payments under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of such section (relating to expenses of administration) and the payments under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section.


(d) Transfers of money and proceeds of property owned by the German Government

All money and other property shall be held to be owned by the German Government (1) if no claim thereto has been filed with the Alien Property Custodian prior to the expiration of three years from March 10, 1928, or (2) if any claim has been filed before the expiration of such period (whether before or after March 10, 1928), then if the ownership thereof under any such claim is not established by a decision of the Alien Property Custodian or by suit in court instituted, under section 4309 of this title, within one year after the decision of the Alien Property Custodian, or after March 10, 1928, whichever date is later. The amounts so transferred under this subsection shall be credited upon the final payment due the United States from the German Government on account of the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission.


(e) Issuance of certificatesThe Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to issue to the Alien Property Custodian, upon such terms and conditions and under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, one or more participating certificates, bearing interest payable annually (as nearly as may be) at the rate of 5 per centum per annum, as evidence of the investment by the Alien Property Custodian under subsection (a), and one or more non-interest bearing participating certificates, as evidence of the investment by the Alien Property Custodian under subsection (b). All such certificates shall evidence a participating interest, in accordance with, and subject to the priorities of, the provisions of section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, in the funds in the German special deposit account created by such section, except that—
(1)
 The United States shall assume no liability, directly or indirectly, for the payment of any such certificates, or of the interest thereon, except out of funds in such special deposit account available therefor, and all such certificates shall so state on their face; and

(2)
 Such certificates shall not be transferable, except that the Alien Property Custodian may transfer any such participating certificate evidencing the interest of a substantial number of the owners of the money invested, to a trustee duly appointed by such owners.


(f) Allocation of amounts among persons filing written consents; payment

Any amount of principal or interest paid to the Alien Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 shall be allocated pro rata among the persons filing written consents under subsection (m) of section 4309 of this title, and the amounts so allocated shall be paid to such persons. If any person to whom any amount is payable under this subsection has died (or if, in the case of a partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or a corporation, its existence has terminated), payment shall be made to the persons determined by the Alien Property Custodian to be entitled thereto.


(g) Transfers of money and proceeds of property owned by Austrian or Hungarian Governments

The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed (after the payment of debts under section 4309 of this title) to transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury, for deposit in the special deposit account (Austrian or Hungarian, as the case may be), created by section 7 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, all money and the proceeds of all property, including all income, dividends, interest, annuities, and earnings accumulated in respect thereof, owned by the Austrian Government or any corporation all the stock of which was owned by or on behalf of the Austrian Government (including the property of the Imperial Royal Tobacco Monopoly, also known under the name of K. K. Oesterreichische Tabak Regie), or owned by the Hungarian Government or by any corporation all the stock of which was owned by or on behalf of the Hungarian Government.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4322 -  Investments by Custodian in participating certificates issued by Secretary of the Treasury; transfers to and payments from German, Austrian or Hungarian special deposit accounts; allocation of payments 


The U.S. Code 50 § 4322 outlines provisions related to investments made by the Alien Property Custodian in certificates issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. It covers several conditions, including the maximum aggregate investment amount, the allocation of payments, and the process for transferring funds to and from German, Austrian, or Hungarian special deposit accounts. It also dictates circumstances under which the Alien Property Custodian may invest in participating certificates issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, and the procedures for allocating payments among persons filing written consents. 

This law also pertains to the Alien Property Custodian's authority to transfer money and property proceeds owned by the German, Austrian, or Hungarian Government to the Secretary of the Treasury. It stipulates that the Secretary of the Treasury can issue participating certificates to the Alien Property Custodian as evidence of investment. 

This code has been amended a couple of times, notably in 1930 and 1929 to adjust the timeframes for claiming ownership of property. The functions of the Alien Property Custodian were later transferred to the Attorney General in 1947.

(a) Allocation among trusts; basis of allocation

The Alien Property Custodian shall allocate among the various trusts the funds in the “unallocated interest fund” (as defined in section 4325 of this title). Such allocation shall be based upon the earnings (determined by the Secretary of the Treasury) on the total amounts deposited under section 4312 of this title.


(b) Payment to persons entitled to distributions

The Alien Property Custodian, when the allocation has been made, is authorized and directed to pay to each person entitled, in accordance with a final decision of a court of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or of an opinion of the Attorney General, to the distribution of any portion of such unallocated interest fund, the amount allocated to his trust, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section.


(c) Credit against amount invested in certificates

In the case of persons entitled, under paragraph (12), (13), (14), or (16) of subsection (b) of section 4309 of this title, to such return, and in the case of persons who would be entitled to such return thereunder if all such money or property had not been returned under paragraph (9) or (10) of such subsection, and in the case of persons entitled to such return under subsection (n) of section 4309 of this title, an amount equal to the aggregate amount allocated to their trusts shall be credited against the sum of $25,000,000 invested in participating certificates under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of section 4322 of this title. If the aggregate amount so allocated is in excess of $25,000,000, an amount equal to the excess shall be invested in the same manner. Upon the repayment of any of the amounts so invested, under the provisions of section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, the amount so repaid shall be distributed pro rata among such persons, notwithstanding any receipts or releases given by them.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4323 -  Allocation of “unallocated interest fund” 


This section of the U.S. Code relates to the allocation of the "unallocated interest fund" by the Alien Property Custodian. Essentially, it sets out the rules and procedures for how the Alien Property Custodian should distribute the funds in this account. The allocation is based on the earnings on the total amounts deposited under a different section of the U.S. Code. Once the allocation has been made, the Custodian is authorized to pay out the allocated amounts to each person who is entitled to a distribution according to a court decision or Attorney General opinion.

Moreover, it also specifies that in the case of certain people who are entitled to a return, the amount allocated to their trusts will be credited against the sum of $25,000,000 invested in participating certificates. If the aggregate amount allocated is more than $25,000,000, the excess amount will be invested in the same manner.

Finally, this section makes clear that the unallocated interest fund is available for carrying out the provisions of this section, including the expenses of making the allocation. The section also references the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, indicating that any repayments under that Act should be distributed among the people entitled to a return.

In summary, this section sets out the guidelines for the allocation and distribution of a specific fund managed by the Alien Property Custodian. It determines who is entitled to a distribution, how much they are entitled to, and how the funds should be allocated and invested. It also makes provisions for the expenses of making the allocation.

The Alien Property Custodian is an office that was created during World War I and later revived during World War II, primarily to seize, administer, and sometimes sell enemy property located within the United States. 

This statute was added to the U.S. Code on March 10, 1928. The statute was later reclassified to its current location in the Code due to editorial changes.

By Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1947, the functions of the Alien Property Custodian and the Office of Alien Property Custodian were transferred to the Attorney General. This plan took effect on July 1, 1947.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4325 -  “Unallocated interest fund” defined 


This section of the U.S. Code defines the term "unallocated interest fund" within the context of this chapter. The unallocated interest fund refers to profits and earnings accumulated due to investments and reinvestments carried out by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to March 4, 1923, and those accumulated after this date related to the previously mentioned earnings and profits. This definition was added to the chapter in 1928.

In simpler terms, this is the financial term for the sum of all the profits and earnings made from various investments managed by the Secretary of the Treasury both before and after a specific date in 1923. 

This law falls under the broader "Trading with the Enemy Act" which was passed in 1917, which is principally classified under this chapter. This act is generally meant to regulate trade with countries that the U.S. is at war with, and the "unallocated interest fund" appears to be a financial element within this larger framework.

(a) Waiver of demand for conveyance of property; acceptance of less amount

Where the Alien Property Custodian has made demand or requirement for the conveyance, transfer, assignment, delivery, or payment to him of any money or other property of any enemy or ally of enemy (whether or not suit or proceeding for the enforcement thereof has been begun and whether or not any judgment or decree in respect thereof has been made or entered) and where the whole or any part of such money or other property would, if conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to him, be returnable under any provision of this chapter, the Alien Property Custodian may, in his discretion, and on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, waive such demand or requirement, or accept in full satisfaction of such demand, requirement, judgment, or decree, a less amount than that demanded or required by him.


(b) Approval of Attorney General; holding of amount for investment

The Alien Property Custodian shall not make any such waiver or compromise except with the approval of the Attorney General; nor (if any part of such money or property would be returnable only upon the filing of the written consent required by subsection (m) of section 4309 of this title) unless, after compliance with the terms and conditions of such waiver or compromise, the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States will hold (in respect of such enemy or ally of enemy) for investment as provided in section 4322 of this title, an amount equal to 20 per centum of the sum of (1) the value of the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States at the time of such waiver or compromise, plus (2) the value of the money or other property to which the Alien Property Custodian would be entitled under such demand or requirement if the waiver or compromise had not been made.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4326 -  Waiver by Custodian of demand for property; acceptance of less amount; approval of Attorney General 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines provisions for the Alien Property Custodian (APC), a government official tasked with managing the property of enemies or allies of enemies. The APC has the discretion to waive demands for property conveyance, transfer, assignment, delivery, or payment from enemies or allies of enemies under certain conditions, and can accept a lesser amount than originally demanded.

The Alien Property Custodian must obtain approval from the Attorney General before waiving or compromising any demands. If a part of the money or property is returnable only upon filing of certain consent, the APC or the Treasurer of the United States must hold 20% of the total value of the money or property for investment.

The APC can also waive demands where the property interest of the enemy or ally of enemy had not vested prior to March 10, 1928, but again, this requires the approval of the Attorney General.

The APC is not required to make any waiver or compromise and can proceed with any demand or requirement as if this law had not been enacted. All money or property received by the APC as a result of any action or proceeding is considered part of the trust and is subject to return under the same conditions as any other money or property in such trust.

The functions of the Alien Property Custodian were transferred to the Attorney General in 1947.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4327 -  Attachment or garnishment of funds or property held by Custodian 


This section of the U.S. Code establishes the process for attaching or garnishing funds or property that is held by the Alien Property Custodian. The Alien Property Custodian is an entity that was created during World War I to assume control of any property belonging to U.S. enemies. This legislation allows for the attachment of such funds or property under the provisions of the District of Columbia code, but stipulates that any writ of attachment or garnishment must be served on the Alien Property Custodian. The section also explicitly states that no officer of any court is authorized to take actual possession of any money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States. 

This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1928, eleven years after the creation of the Alien Property Custodian. The functions of the Alien Property Custodian were later transferred to the Attorney General in 1947.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4328 -  “Member of the former ruling family” defined 


This section of the U.S. Code defines the term "member of the former ruling family" as it is used in this chapter. In this context, it refers to any person who, between April 6, 1917, and July 2, 1921, was the German Emperor or the ruler of any constituent kingdom of the German Empire, or the wife or any child of such a person. This law was initially added in 1917, in relation to the Trading with the enemy Act, and later amended in 1928.

In layman's terms, the U.S. government created legal definitions for who would be considered part of the former ruling family of Germany during and after World War I. This likely was enacted to assist with the enforcement of sanctions, reparations, or other post-war policies. As this law applies to a very specific group of people and a specific time frame in the early 20th century, it is likely not frequently invoked today. 

The original law, the Trading with the Enemy Act, was introduced during World War I, giving the president the power to oversee or restrict any and all trade between the U.S. and its enemies in times of war. This specific section was added later in 1928.

and

(3)

(5)
 that such return is in the interest of the United States.


(b) Extension of filing time limitation for redetermination of excessive profits

Notwithstanding the limitation prescribed in the Renegotiation Act upon the time within which petitions may be filed in The Tax Court of the United States,[1] any person to whom any property or interest or proceeds are returned hereunder shall, for a period of ninety days (not counting Sunday or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the last day) following return, have the right to file such a petition for a redetermination in respect of any final order of the Renegotiation Board [2] determining excessive profits, made against the Alien Property Custodian, or of any determination, not embodied in an agreement, of excessive profits, so made by or on behalf of a Secretary.


(c) Inventions

Any person to whom any invention, whether patented or unpatented, or any right or interest therein is returned hereunder shall be bound by any notice or order issued or agreement made pursuant to the Act of October 31, 1942 (56 Stat. 1013), in respect of such invention or right or interest, and such person to whom a licensor’s interest is returned shall have all rights assertible by a licensor pursuant to section 2 of the said Act.


(d) Rights and duties

Except as otherwise provided herein, and except to the extent that the President or such officer or agency as he may designate may otherwise determine, any person to whom return is made hereunder shall have all rights, privileges, and obligations in respect to the property or interest returned or the proceeds of which are returned which would have existed if the property or interest had not vested in the Alien Property Custodian, but no cause of action shall accrue to such person in respect of any deduction or retention of any part of the property or interest or proceeds by the Alien Property Custodian for the purpose of paying taxes, costs, or expenses in connection with such property or interest or proceeds: Provided, That except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) hereof, no person to whom a return is made pursuant to this section, nor the successor in interest of such person, shall acquire or have any claim or right of action against the United States or any department, establishment or agency thereof, or corporation owned thereby, or against any person authorized or licensed by the United States, founded upon the retention, sale, or other disposition, or use, during the period it was vested in the Alien Property Custodian, of the returned property, interest, or proceeds. Any notice to the Alien Property Custodian in respect of any property or interest or proceeds shall constitute notice to the person to whom such property or interest or proceeds is returned and such person shall succeed to all burdens and obligations in respect of such property or interest or proceeds which accrued during the time of retention by the Alien Property Custodian, but the period during which the property or interest or proceeds returned were vested in the Alien Property Custodian shall not be included for the purpose of determining the application of any statute of limitations to the assertion of any rights by such person in respect of such property or interest or proceeds.


(e) Legal proceeding unaffected

No return hereunder shall bar the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against a person to whom return has been made, to establish any right, title, or interest, which may exist or which may have existed at the time of vesting, in or to the property or interest returned, but no such suit may be prosecuted by any person ineligible to receive a return under subsection (a)(2) hereof. With respect to any such suit, the period during which the property or interest or proceeds returned were vested in the Alien Property Custodian shall not be included for the purpose of determining the application of any statute of limitations.


(f) Notice of intention

At least thirty days before making any return to any person other than a resident of the United States or a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, the President or such officer or agency as he may designate shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of intention to make such return, specifying therein the person to whom return is to be made and the place where the property or interest or proceeds to be returned are located. Publication of a notice of intention to return shall confer no right of action upon any person to compel the return of any such property or interest or proceeds, and such notice of intention to return may be revoked by appropriate notice in the Federal Register. After publication of such notice of intention and prior to revocation thereof, the property or interest or proceeds specified shall be subject to attachment at the suit of any citizen or resident of the United States or any corporation organized under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, in the same manner as property of the person to whom return is to be made: Provided, That notice of any writ of attachment which may issue prior to return shall be served upon the Alien Property Custodian. Any such attachment proceeding shall be subject to the provisions of law relating to limitation of actions applicable to actions at law in the jurisdiction in which such proceeding is brought, but the period during which the property or interest or proceeds were vested in the Alien Property Custodian shall not be included for the purpose of determining the period of limitation. No officer of any court shall take actual possession, without the consent of the Alien Property Custodian, of any property or interest or proceeds so attached, and publication of a notice of revocation of intention to return shall invalidate any attachment with respect to the specified property or interest or proceeds, but if there is no such revocation, the President or such officer or agency as he may designate shall accord full effect to any such attachment in returning any such property or interest or proceeds.


(g) Payment of expenses of Custodian

Without limitation by or upon any other existing provision of law with respect to the payment of expenses by the Alien Property Custodian, the Custodian may retain or recover from any property or interest or proceeds returned pursuant to this section or section 4309(a) of this title an amount not exceeding that expended or incurred by him for the conservation, preservation, or maintenance of such property or interest or proceeds, or other property or interest or proceeds returned to the same person.


(h) Designation of successor organizations to receive heirless property; time for application; payment of funds: time, allocation, claims barred by acceptance and conditions

The President may designate one or more organizations as successors in interest to deceased persons who, if alive, would be eligible to receive returns under the provisos of subdivision (C) or (D) of subsection (a)(2) thereof.[3] In the case of any organization not so designated before the date of enactment of this amendment, such organization may be so designated only if it applies for such designation within three months after such date of enactment.
The President, or such officer as he may designate, shall, before the expiration of the one-year period which begins on the date of enactment of this amendment, pay out of the War Claims Fund to organizations designated before or after the date of enactment of this amendment pursuant to this subsection the sum of $500,000. If there is more than one such designated organization, such sum shall be allocated among such organizations in the proportions in which the proceeds of heirless property were distributed, pursuant to agreements to which the United States was a party, by the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees and successor organizations thereto. Acceptance of payment pursuant to this subsection by any such organization shall constitute a full and complete discharge of all claims filed by such organization pursuant to this section, as it existed before the date of enactment of this amendment.
No payment may be made to any organization designated under this section unless it has given firm and responsible assurances approved by the President that (1) the payment will be used on the basis of need in the rehabilitation and settlement of persons in the United States who suffered substantial deprivation of liberty or failed to enjoy the full rights of citizenship within the meaning of subdivisions (C) and (D) of subsection (a)(2) of this section; (2) it will make to the President, with a copy to be furnished to the Congress, such reports (including a detailed annual report on the use of the payment made to it) and permit such examination of its books as the President, or such officer or agency as he may designate, may from time to time require; and (3) it will not use any part of such payment for legal fees, salaries, or other administrative expenses connected with the filing of claims for such payment or for the recovery of any property or interest under this section.
As used in this subsection, “organization” means only a nonprofit charitable corporation incorporated on or before January 1, 1950, under the laws of any State of the United States or of the District of Columbia with the power to sue and be sued.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4329 -  Return of property 


The U.S. Code 50 § 4329 refers to the return of property in the context of wartime and post-war circumstances. It outlines the conditions under which property or interest vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian may be returned. 

It states that the property or interest should be returned to the person who was the owner before it was transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, or their legal representative or successor. It also specifies certain countries and individuals who are not eligible to receive a return, mostly relating to countries that the U.S. was at war with or occupied by during World War II, such as Germany, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.

Furthermore, return of the property or interest is conditional upon it not being used after September 1, 1939, to conceal any property or interest within the U.S of any person ineligible to receive a return.

The section also specifies certain rights and obligations for any person to whom return is made, and limits any claims or actions against the U.S. government or any authorized person for the retention, sale, or other disposition, or use, of the returned property, interest, or proceeds during the period it was vested in the Alien Property Custodian.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4330 -  Notice of claim; institution of suits; computation of time 


This U.S. Code section sets out the timelines for filing claims and instituting suits related to property or interest that was acquired by the U.S. from foreign entities. It differentiates between property acquired before and after December 18, 1941, setting the deadline for the former as August 9, 1948, and for the latter as either one year from February 9, 1954, or two years from the vesting of the property, whichever is later. It also sets a deadline for instituting a suit as either April 30, 1949, or two years from the seizure or vesting of the property, excluding any period during which a suit or claim for return was pending.

The code section has been amended multiple times, with changes introduced in 1947, 1948, 1954, and 1962. The amendments have generally extended deadlines, allowed for claims to be filed by successor organizations, and replaced specific dates with flexible timelines based on the date of vesting or seizure. The functions of the Alien Property Custodian, referenced in this section, have been transferred to the Attorney General.

(a) Claims allowable; defenses

Any property or interest vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the net proceeds thereof, shall be equitably applied by the Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this section to the payment of debts owed by the person who owned such property or interest immediately prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian. No debt claim shall be allowed under this section if it was not due and owing at the time of such vesting or transfer, or if it arose from any action or transactions prohibited by or pursuant to this chapter and not licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant thereto, or (except in the case of debt claims acquired by the Custodian) if it was at the time of such vesting or transfer due and owing to any person who has since the beginning of the war been convicted of violation of this chapter, as amended, sections 1 to 6 of the Criminal Code, title I of the Act of June 15, 1917 (ch. 30, 40 Stat. 217), as amended; the Act of April 20, 1918 (ch. 59, 40 Stat. 534), as amended; the Act of June 8, 1934 [1] (ch. 327, 52 Stat. 631), as amended; the Act of January 12, 1938 (ch. 2, 52 Stat. 3); title I, Alien Registration Act, 1940 (ch. 439, 54 Stat. 670); the Act of October 17, 1940 (ch. 897, 54 Stat. 1201); or the Act of June 25, 1942 (ch. 447, 56 Stat. 390). Any defense to the payment of such claims which would have been available to the debtor shall be available to the Custodian, except that the period from and after the beginning of the war shall not be included for the purpose of determining the application of any statute of limitations. Debt claims allowable hereunder shall include only those of citizens of the United States or of the Philippine Islands; those of corporations organized under the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia or the Philippine Islands; those of other natural persons who are and have been since the beginning of the war residents of the United States and who have not during the war been interned or paroled pursuant to the Alien Enemy Act; and those acquired by the Custodian. Legal representatives (whether or not appointed by a court in the United States) or successors in interest by inheritance, devise, bequest, or operation of law or debt claimants, other than persons who would themselves be disqualified hereunder from allowance of a debt claim, shall be eligible for payment to the same extent as their principals or predecessors would have been.


(b) Time limit for filing claims; extension; notice

The Custodian shall fix a date or dates after which the filing of debt claims in respect of any or all debtors shall be barred, and may extend the time so fixed, and shall give at least sixty days’ notice thereof by publication in the Federal Register. In no event shall the time extend beyond the expiration of two years from the date of the last vesting in or transfer to the Custodian of any property or interest of a debtor in respect of whose debts the date is fixed, or from August 8, 1946, whichever is later. No debt shall be paid prior to the expiration of one hundred and twenty days after publication of the first such notice in respect of the debtor, nor in any event shall any payment of a debt claim be made out of any property or interest or proceeds in respect of which a suit or proceeding pursuant to this chapter for return is pending and was instituted prior to the expiration of such one hundred and twenty days.


(c) Examination of claims

The Custodian shall examine the claims, and such evidence in respect thereof as may be presented to him or as he may introduce into the record, and shall make a determination, with respect to each claim, of allowance or disallowance, in whole or in part.


(d) Funds for debt payments

Payment of debt claims shall be made only out of such money included in, or received as net proceeds from the sale, use, or other disposition of, any property or interest owned by the debtor immediately prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian, as shall remain after deduction of (1) the amount of the expenses of the Office of Alien Property Custodian (including both expenses in connection with such property or interest or proceeds thereof, and such portion as the Custodian shall fix of the other expenses of the Office of Alien Property Custodian), and of taxes, as defined in section 4333 of this title, paid by the Custodian in respect of such property or interest or proceeds, and (2) such amount, if any, as the Custodian may establish as a cash reserve for the future payment of such expenses and taxes. If the money available hereunder for the payment of debt claims against the debtor is insufficient for the satisfaction of all claims allowed by the Custodian, ratable payments shall be made in accordance with subsection (g) hereof to the extent permitted by the money available and additional payments shall be made whenever the Custodian shall determine that substantial further money has become available, through liquidation of any such property or interest or otherwise. The Custodian shall not be required through any judgment of any court, levy of execution, or otherwise to sell or liquidate any property or interest vested in or transferred to him, for the purpose of paying or satisfying any debt claim.


(e) Amount payable; disallowance; notice; review; additional evidence; judgment

If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed does not exceed the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made, the Custodian shall pay each claim to the extent allowed, and shall serve by registered mail, on each claimant whose claim is disallowed in whole or in part, a notice of such disallowance. Within sixty days after the date of mailing of the Custodian’s determination, any debt claimant whose claim has been disallowed in whole or in part may file in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such disallowance naming the Custodian as defendant. Such complaint shall be served on the Custodian. The Custodian, within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings in the Office of Alien Property Custodian with respect to the claim in question. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claim as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the Custodian or introduced into the record by him, and the determination of the Custodian with respect thereto, including any findings made by him. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the Custodian, or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. The court shall enter judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the Custodian’s determination, and directing payment in the amount, if any, which it finds due.


(f) Pro rata payments; notice; review; additional evidence; intervention; judgment

If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed exceeds the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made, the Custodian shall prepare and serve by registered mail on all claimants a schedule of all debt claims allowed and the proposed payment to each claimant. In preparing such schedule, the Custodian shall assign priorities in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) hereof. Within sixty days after the date of mailing of such schedule, any claimant considering himself aggrieved may file in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such schedule, naming the Custodian as defendant. A copy of such complaint shall be served upon the Custodian and on each claimant named in the schedule. The Custodian, within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings in the Office of Alien Property Custodian with respect to such schedule. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claims in question as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the Custodian or introduced into the record by him, any findings or other determinations made by the Custodian with respect thereto, and the schedule prepared by the Custodian. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the Custodian or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. Any interested debt claimant who has filed a claim with the Custodian pursuant to this section, upon timely application to the court, shall be permitted to intervene in such review proceedings. The court shall enter judgment affirming or modifying the schedule as prepared by the Custodian and directing payment, if any be found due, pursuant to the schedule as affirmed or modified and to the extent of the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made. Pending the decision of the court on such complaint for review, and pending final determination of any appeal from such decision, payment may be made only to an extent, if any, consistent with the contentions of all claimants for review.


(g) Priority of claims

Debt claims shall be paid in the following order of priority: (1) Wage and salary claims, not to exceed $600; (2) claims entitled to priority under sections 3713(a) and 9309 of title 31, except as provided in subsection (h) hereof, (3) all other claims for services rendered, for expenses incurred in connection with such services, for rent, for goods and materials delivered to the debtor, and for payments made to the debtor for goods or services not received by the claimant; (4) all other debt claims. No payment shall be made to claimants within a subordinate class unless the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made permits payment in full of all allowed claims in every prior class.


(h) Priority as debt due United States

No debt of any kind shall be entitled to priority under any law of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, solely by reason of becoming a debt due or owing to the United States as a result of its acquisition by the Alien Property Custodian.


(i) Exclusiveness of relief

The sole relief and remedy available to any person seeking satisfaction of a debt claim out of any property or interest which shall have been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the proceeds thereof, shall be the relief and remedy provided in this section, and suits for the satisfaction of debt claims shall not be instituted, prosecuted, or further maintained except in conformity with this section: Provided, That no person asserting any interest, right, or title in any property or interest or proceeds acquired by the Alien Property Custodian, shall be barred from proceeding pursuant to this chapter for the return thereof, by reason of any proceeding which he may have brought pursuant to this section; nor shall any security interest asserted by the creditor in any such property or interest or proceeds be deemed to have been waived solely by reason of such proceeding. The Alien Property Custodian shall treat all debt claims now filed with him as claims filed pursuant to this section. Nothing contained in this section shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the original debtor or against any other person who may be liable for the payment of any debt for which a claim might have been filed hereunder. No purchaser, lessee, licensee, or other transferee of any property or interest from the Alien Property Custodian shall, solely by reason of such purchase, lease, license, or transfer, become liable for the payment of any debt owed by the person who owned such property or interest prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian. Payment by the Alien Property Custodian to any debt claimant shall constitute, to the extent of payment, a discharge of the indebtedness represented by the claim.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4331 -  Payment of debts 


The U.S. Code § 4331 outlines the process for the payment of debts associated with property vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, an official responsible for dealing with property of enemy aliens during times of war. The Code stipulates that the property's net proceeds should be used to pay the debts of the original owner. However, some claims may be disallowed based on factors such as being in violation of certain acts, statutes, or laws. 

Claimants eligible for payment under this section include U.S. and Philippine citizens, corporations organized under U.S. law, residents of the U.S. who have not been interned during the war, and claims acquired by the Custodian. 

The Custodian is required to set a deadline for the filing of claims and must give a 60-day notice of this deadline. Claims will not be paid before 120 days after the first notice regarding the debtor is published. The Custodian examines and determines whether to allow or disallow each claim.

The funds used to pay these debts come from the net proceeds of the sale or use of the debtor's property after the deduction of certain expenses and taxes. If the funds are insufficient to cover all claims, ratable payments are made based on availability. The Custodian is not required to sell or liquidate any property for the purpose of paying debt claims.

The process for reviewing disallowed claims or grievances due to proposed payment schedules is also outlined. Claims are paid in a particular order of priority, starting with wage and salary claims not exceeding $600.

(a) Liability; exemptions

The vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian of any property or interest (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the receipt by him of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for any period prior or subsequent to the date of such vesting or transfer, nor render applicable the exemptions provided in title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] with respect to service performed in the employ of the United States Government or of any instrumentality of the United States.


(b) Payment by Custodian; liability of former owner; enforcement of tax liability; transfer of property

The Alien Property Custodian shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution of any suit under this chapter, pay any tax incident to any such property or interest, or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, interest, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by the Alien Property Custodian, unless they are returned pursuant to this chapter without payment of such tax by the Alien Property Custodian. Every such tax shall be paid by the Alien Property Custodian to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property or interest had not been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid only out of the property or interest, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property or interests acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property or interest or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held by the Alien Property Custodian except with his consent. Where any property or interest is transferred, otherwise than pursuant to section 4309(a) or 4329 of this title, the Alien Property Custodian may transfer the property or interest free and clear of any tax, except to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, replace the property or interest in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian.


(c) Computation; suspension of limitations, etc.

Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or would be entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes and the extent of any compliance by the Custodian with provisions of Federal law and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury to effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on assessment, collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended, with respect to any vested property or interest, or the earnings, increment or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.


(d) “Tax” defined

The word “tax” as used in this section shall include, without limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income, excess-profits, war-profits, excise, estate and employment tax, import duty, and special assessment; and also any interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition thereto not arising from any act, omission, neglect, failure, or delay on the part of the Custodian.


(e) Exemptions

Any tax exemption accorded to the Alien Property Custodian by specific provision of existing law shall not be affected by this section.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4333 -  Taxes 


This section prescribes the tax liabilities and exemptions related to properties vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, an official responsible for managing properties owned by non-U.S. citizens.

Subsection (a) states that these properties are not exempt from federal, state, or local taxes, and are not subject to exemptions under the Social Security Act. 

Subsection (b) obligates the Alien Property Custodian to pay any taxes related to these properties, regardless of any claims or lawsuits. The former owner is not liable for taxes while the property is held by the Custodian unless it is returned without the payment of tax. 

Subsection (c) provides that federal taxes should be computed according to regulations set by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. It also suspends statutes of limitations on tax assessments, collections, refunds, or credits for vested property.

Subsection (d) defines "tax" to include multiple forms, including property, income, excess-profits, war-profits, excise, estate and employment tax, import duty, and special assessment. 

Subsection (e) asserts that any existing tax exemptions accorded to the Alien Property Custodian are not affected by this section. 

This law was added on December 18, 1941, and is primarily associated with the Trading with the Enemy Act. The Alien Property Custodian's functions were later transferred to the Attorney General in 1947.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4334 -  Insurance of property 


This section of the U.S. code empowers the Alien Property Custodian with the authority to procure insurance that they believe will adequately protect them against any loss in relation to property, interest, or proceeds under their control. The Alien Property Custodian is a role established in the early 20th century and their functions were transferred to the Attorney General in 1947. The section was initially added in 1941 and amended in 1946. The language suggests that the custodian has considerable discretion in determining the type and amount of insurance coverage required. Prior to being classified as this section, it was classified differently in the code.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4335 -  Shipment of relief supplies; definitions 


This section of the U.S. Code allows for the donation and delivery of relief supplies like food, clothing, and medicine to any country that the U.S. has been at war with, after the cessation of hostilities. The law applies to any person in the U.S., defined broadly to include individuals, partnerships, associations, companies, and other types of organizations. The date of cessation of hostilities is defined as the date of enactment of the law for wars that ended before 1946 and as the date specified by Presidential proclamation or Congressional resolution for later wars.

In simpler terms, this law says that once a war with another country is over, people in the U.S. are allowed to send aid to that country. This aid can come in various forms, including food, clothes, and medicine. The law applies to everyone, not just specific organizations or government agencies. The exact date when the war is considered over can vary, depending on when the war ended and who declares it to be over.

One possible interpretation of this law's purpose could be to facilitate humanitarian efforts and help rebuild countries the U.S. has been at war with. However, the law might also be seen as a form of soft diplomacy or a way to improve international relations after a conflict.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4336 -  Retention of properties or interests of Germany and Japan and their nationals; proceeds covered into Treasury; ex gratia payment to Switzerland 


50 U.S. Code § 4336 governs the retention of properties or interests of Germany and Japan and their nationals that were vested in or transferred to any officer or agency of the U.S. Government after December 17, 1941. Notably, the statute asserts that no such property or interest shall be returned to the former owners or their successors, and the U.S. shall not pay any compensation for it. The net proceeds from such properties should be covered into the Treasury at the earliest practicable date.

The law also directs the Attorney General to cover into the Treasury all sums received from property vested in or transferred to the Attorney General under this chapter, after August 23, 1988, and before that date which had not been covered into the Treasury for deposit in the War Claims Fund.

The code includes a unique provision authorizing an ex gratia payment of $20,000 from the vested or transferred property to the Government of Switzerland in line with an agreement between Switzerland and the U.S. signed on March 12, 1980.

The code has been revised and amended several times since its inception in 1917, including changes in 1953, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1985, and 1988.

Ex. Ord. No. 10244, May 17, 1951, 16 F.R. 4639, provided:
1. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are hereby jointly designated as the officers authorized to conclude and give effect to agreements relating to the settlement of intercustodial conflicts involving enemy property made pursuant to the said act of September 28, 1950 [50 U.S.C. 4337], and to exercise all powers incident thereto which are conferred by such act, including, without limitation, the powers to receive, transfer, release or return property, interests therein, or proceeds thereof.
2. It is the policy of this order that the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, shall perform all functions necessary or appropriate to give effect to any agreement made pursuant to the said act of September 28, 1950, with relation to the protection of American interests in property outside the United States, and that the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, shall perform all functions necessary or appropriate to give effect to any such agreement with relation to property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and that all other functions relating to the effectuation of any such agreement shall be performed as may be agreed by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. However, no action taken hereunder by either the Secretary of State or the Attorney General shall be considered to be invalid on the ground that under the provisions of this order such action was within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State rather than the Attorney General, or vice versa, or that concurrence was not obtained, or that such action was not joint.
3. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General may each delegate to the other or to any other officer, person, or agency within his respective department such of his functions under this order as he may deem necessary.
4. Any money, property, or interest received as reimbursement by the United States by virtue of any agreement made pursuant to the said act of September 28, 1950, shall be administered and disposed of by the Attorney General as vested property pursuant to the said Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended [50 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.]. Any other money, property, or interest received by the Secretary of State or the Attorney General pursuant to any such agreement shall be administered and disposed of pursuant to the provisions of such agreement.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4337 -  Intercustodial conflicts involving enemy property; authority of President to conclude; delegation of authority 


This section of the U.S. Code gives the President, or any officer or agency he designates, the authority to create and implement agreements that help to resolve disputes over enemy property in a friendly and efficient manner. However, this authority only extends to agreements with countries that the U.S. was not at war with during World War II. 

The agreements should aim to protect and make use of American and non-enemy interests in such property while also trying to eliminate enemy interests. The goal should also be to efficiently administer and liquidate enemy property in the U.S.

This section also stipulates that, in any future intergovernmental agreements, the U.S. should strive to receive equal treatment for people who were citizens or residents of an enemy country before or during WWII but were denied full citizenship rights or significantly deprived of freedom by laws, decrees, or regulations of such enemy countries that were discriminatory against racial, religious, or political groups. 

This is provided that they were permanent residents of the U.S., had expressed their intention to become U.S. citizens in compliance with the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended and have acquired U.S. citizenship before the effective date of any future intergovernmental agreement.

Any reimbursement received by the U.S. from other governments as per the agreements should be treated as vested property. However, nothing in this section should prevent, restrict, or limit the payment of claims from the War Claims Fund established by section 4110 of this title, as amended. 

The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are designated to conclude and implement these agreements, with clear delineations of their respective responsibilities. They can also delegate their functions to others within their departments if needed.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4338 -  Divestment of estates, trusts, insurance policies, annuities, remainders, pensions, workmen’s compensation and veterans’ benefits; exceptions; notice of divestment 


This section of the U.S. Code, added in 1962, concerns the divestment of assets such as estate, trusts, insurance policies, annuities, pensions, workers' compensation, and veterans' benefits. The law states that all such assets vested under this chapter after December 17, 1941, which have not been made payable or deliverable to or have not vested in possession in the Attorney General prior to December 31, 1961, are divested. The Attorney General, however, retains the right to retain all such property rights and interests and to collect all income which is payable to or vested in possession in him prior to December 31, 1961.

An exception to this requirement is made if the beneficial owner of any such interest is a natural person who has been personally and by name convicted by a competent court of specific serious crimes, including murder, ill-treatment, deportation for slave labor, or wanton destruction without justified military necessity.

The Attorney General is required to provide written notice of any divestment to the lawful owner or custodian at the earliest practicable time after the enactment of the act.

In simpler terms, this law essentially deals with the responsibility of the Attorney General regarding the ownership and divestment of certain assets. It provides specific guidelines about the circumstances and timing under which these assets are to be divested, or relinquished, with an exception for individuals who have been convicted of certain heinous crimes.

This section of the U.S Code outlines the procedures and regulations for handling claims against the United States for property that was seized under certain circumstances, specifically those related to "alien property" (property owned by non-U.S. citizens). This includes the sale of certain certificates and the divestment of copyrights. 

Key points include:

1. The U.S Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over these types of cases, regardless of any prior decisions, compromises, releases, or assignments to the Alien Property Custodian.

2. Copyrights include not only the copyrights themselves, but also claims, rights, and renewals related to copyrights.

3. Certain copyrights that were vested in the Alien Property Custodian or the Attorney General are divested, meaning they are returned to their original owners or otherwise disposed of. However, the U.S retains the right to reproduce or exhibit any divested copyrighted motion pictures for its own use.

4. The Attorney General has the right to collect and receive any unpaid royalties or other income accrued from the divested copyrights prior to the day of divestment.

5. The Attorney General retains the right to sue for copyright infringement during the period between the vesting of rights and interests and the day of divestment.

These provisions were added to the act in 1962 and have been amended a few times since then, most recently in 1992. These amendments mainly concern changes in terminology and the timeline for instituting proceedings.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the effective date of divestment of the trademarks so listed and published in the Federal Register shall be the date of publication in the Federal Register by the Secretary of State of a certification identifying the cases in which an equivalent trademark has been registered in the Federal Republic of Germany for a person residing or having its sole or primary seat in the Federal Republic of Germany or in the western sectors of Berlin.

### commentary on ##  50 U.S. Code § 4340 -  Divestment of trademarks 


This section of the U.S. Code regards the divestment, or disposal, of trademarks. The definition of "trademarks" in this section extends to include trade names and the goodwill associated with a business' trademark or trade name.

The law primarily relates to trademarks held by the Alien Property Custodian or the Attorney General under certain circumstances after December 17, 1941. The law details that such trademarks, if not already returned or disposed of, are to be divested and given back to the persons entitled to them. However, the rights of licensees under licenses issued by the Custodian or the Attorney General are preserved.

The Attorney General retains the rights to any unpaid royalties or other income accrued before the day of divestment. The law similarly addresses the divestment of rights or interests arising from prevesting contracts related to trademarks. The Attorney General retains the right to collect any unpaid royalties or income accrued before the day of divestment.

The law also instructs the Attorney General to publish a list of trademarks owned by persons resident in certain areas of Germany (now part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation or under Soviet or Polish administration) and specifies the process of divesting these trademarks.

In summary, this law deals with the process of giving back ("divesting") trademarks and the associated rights that were previously held by the Alien Property Custodian or the Attorney General under certain conditions. Importantly, it preserves the rights of licensees and allows the Attorney General to collect any unpaid royalties or income.
