### commentary on ## § 2-101. Short Title.


The short title of this Article is 'Uniform Commercial Code-Sales.' This law is generally referred to as the UCC-Sales. The UCC-Sales regulates transactions related to the sale of goods, and it is used across the United States. It does not cover certain security and other transactions, which are explicitly excluded. This law is known for its uniformity and consistency, intended to make commerce across state lines easier. It was developed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute, and it has been adopted, with some modifications, by all 50 states.

Unless the context otherwise requires, this Article applies to transactions in goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this Article impair or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.

### commentary on ## § 2-102. Scope; Certain Security and Other Transactions Excluded From This Article.


This section specifies that this Article is intended to cover transactions in goods, but excludes transactions that are structured as sales contracts but are essentially security transactions. Additionally, this Article does not infringe on any laws that regulate sales to specific groups, such as consumers, farmers, etc. 

In summary, this Article is intended to cover the sale of goods, but not if these sales are actually intended as a way of securing some kind of financial arrangement. Furthermore, it doesn't interfere with any laws that govern sales to specific groups of people. If you're selling to a farmer, for example, this Article doesn't overrule any laws that specifically deal with farmers.

### commentary on ## § 2-103. Definitions and Index of Definitions.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code provides key definitions for terms used throughout Article 2, which covers laws related to the sale of goods. 

The definitions include:
- "Buyer", defined as a person who buys or contracts to buy goods.
- "Good faith", defined in the context of a merchant as honesty and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.
- "Receipt" of goods, which involves taking physical possession of the items.
- "Seller", which refers to a person who sells or contracts to sell goods.

The section also refers to other definitions found in different sections of Article 2, such as "acceptance", "cancellation", "contract for sale", "sale", and "termination", among others.

Additionally, definitions from other Articles, like Article 3 and Article 7, are also applied to this Article, including "check", "consignee", "consignor", and "dishonor".

Finally, Article 1's general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation are also applicable throughout this Article.

This section essentially serves as a glossary for the terms used in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, providing a clear and standardized understanding of these terms for legal purposes.

## § 2-104. Definitions: "Merchant"; "Between Merchants"; "Financing Agency". 


Primary tabs







(1) "Merchant" means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.(2) "Financing agency" means a bank, finance company or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection whether or not documents of title accompany the draft. "Financing agency" includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (Section 2-707).(3) "Between Merchants" means in any transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants.

### commentary on ## § 2-104. Definitions: "Merchant"; "Between Merchants"; "Financing Agency". 


This section provides definitions for three important terms in the context of commercial transactions.

1) "Merchant" refers to a person who has specialized knowledge or skill in a certain area or field, either by dealing in particular goods or by virtue of their occupation. This knowledge or skill can also be attributed to them if they employ an agent, broker or other intermediary who has this expertise.

2) "Financing agency" is defined as any entity - typically a bank or finance company - that makes advances against goods or documents of title. This could be by making or collecting payments under a sales contract, by purchasing or paying the seller's drafts, by advancing against these drafts, or by simply taking them for collection. Importantly, this definition also includes entities that intervene in a similar manner between seller and buyer positions in relation to goods.

3) "Between Merchants" is a term used to describe a transaction in which both parties are assumed to have the knowledge or skill of merchants. Essentially, this means that both parties are held to the standards of professionals in their field.

These definitions are important in understanding the roles and responsibilities of different parties in commercial transactions.

## § 2-105. Definitions: Transferability; "Goods"; "Future" Goods; "Lot"; "Commercial Unit".


Primary tabs







(1) "Goods" means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in action. "Goods" also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (Section 2-107).(2) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are "future" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contractto sell.(3) There may be a saleof a part interest in existing identified goods.(4) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyerwho then becomes an owner in common.(5) "Lot" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract.(6) "Commercial unit" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of saleand division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.

### commentary on ## § 2-105. Definitions: Transferability; "Goods"; "Future" Goods; "Lot"; "Commercial Unit".


This section provides definitions of various terms related to the sale and transfer of goods. "Goods" are defined as all movable things, excluding money, investment securities, and things in action. The term also includes unborn animals, growing crops, and things attached to realty. 

"Future goods" refers to goods that do not exist or are not identified at the time of the contract. Such goods do not transfer any ownership interest until they exist and are identified. 

A "lot" refers to a parcel or a single item that is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery. 

A "commercial unit" is a unit of goods that is considered a single whole in terms of commercial usage or market relevance. Breaking up a commercial unit may significantly impair its value or functionality. 

These definitions are crucial in understanding and interpreting the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code related to the sale of goods.

Primary tabs







(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.(2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.(3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.(4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

### commentary on ## § 2-106. Definitions: "Contract"; "Agreement"; "Contract for sale"; "Sale"; "Present sale"; "Conforming" to Contract; "Termination"; "Cancellation".


This section provides definitions for various terms related to contractual agreements, primarily focused on sales of goods.

1) The terms "contract" and "agreement" are limited to commitments involving current or future sales of goods. A "contract for sale" can refer to an existing sale of goods or a promise to sell goods in the future. A "sale" is defined by the transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer for a specified price, while a "present sale" refers to a sale that is finalized upon making the agreement. 

2) Goods or conduct are deemed "conforming" to the contract when they meet the obligations outlined within the agreement. 

3) "Termination" refers to the ending of a contract — not due to a breach, but instead based on either the agreement's terms or under the law. It discharges any remaining obligations on both sides, but rights based on previous breaches or performances are preserved. 

4) "Cancellation" is similar to termination, except it happens when one party ends the contract due to a breach by the other party. It has the same effect as termination, but the party who cancelled the contract also retains any remedies for the breach of the entire contract or any unperformed parts of the agreement.

These definitions provide clarity for legal discussions and proceedings, allowing parties to better understand their rights, obligations, and the consequences of their actions.

PART 2. FORM, FORMATION AND READJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT ›







### commentary on ## § 2-107. Goods to Be Severed From Realty: Recording.


The above section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) addresses the sale of goods that are to be severed from real property, i.e., land and anything attached to it. This can include minerals, oil, gas, structures, and their materials. 

Subsection (1) categorizes contracts for the sale of minerals or structures that are to be removed from the property as a contract for the sale of goods, not land. However, until the actual severance or removal occurs, such a contract is only effective as a promise to sell, not a complete sale.

Subsection (2) applies to contracts for the sale of growing crops or other things that are attached to the property but can be removed without causing significant damage. Such contracts are also categorized as contracts for the sale of goods, regardless of whether the buyer or the seller is to perform the severance. The parties can effect a present sale before severance by properly identifying the goods in question.

Subsection (3) makes it clear that these provisions do not override any third party rights provided by real property law. Furthermore, the contract for sale can be recorded as a document transferring an interest in land, which would then serve as notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract.

In simpler terms, this section of the UCC deals with the sale of things that are currently part of real property but are to be removed and sold as individual goods. Until these goods are actually removed, the transaction is only a promise to sell. Also, while this section allows the contract to be recorded as a land transfer document, it respects existing third-party rights under real estate law.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within 10 days after it is received.(3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or(c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (Sec. 2-606).

### commentary on ## § 2-201. Formal Requirements; Statute of Frauds.


The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Section 2-201, also known as the Statute of Frauds, states that any contract for the sale of goods costing $500 or more must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. This is to protect parties from false oral contracts and possible fraudulent claims. 

If a term is omitted or incorrectly stated, this does not invalidate the contract, but it limits the enforceability to the quantity of goods specified in the writing. 

For merchants, a written confirmation of the contract that is received within a reasonable time is sufficient if the receiving party has reason to know its contents. If the receiving party has any objections, they must give written notice within 10 days.

The statute provides exceptions for special situations such as goods specially manufactured for the buyer, admission of the contract by the party against whom enforcement is sought, or goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted. 

For example, suppose Bob orders a customized wedding ring from Jane's Jewelry Store costing over $500. Even if Bob orally promises to pay, the UCC statute of frauds requires a written contract. If there's no written contract, Jane might still enforce the contract if she has made a substantial beginning on the ring or if Bob admits in court that a contract was made. 

The goal is to have clarity, prevent misunderstandings and provide evidence of the agreement. 

The next part of the UCC, Section 2-202, discusses the use of external evidence to interpret or supplement a contract.

### commentary on ## § 2-202. Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code concerns the final written agreement between parties. It states that any terms agreed upon in the final written agreement cannot be contradicted by any previous agreement or any verbal agreement made at the same time. This final agreement, however, can be explained or expanded upon by previous business dealings or trade practices, as well as the way the agreement has been carried out. This can also include evidence of consistent additional terms, unless the court determines that the written agreement was intended to be the complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

In simpler terms, once you've put your agreement in writing and intended it to be the final version, you can't go back and claim that earlier or verbal agreements change what it says. You can, however, use evidence of past practices and performance to explain or add to it, unless the court decides that your written agreement was supposed to be the be-all and end-all of your deal.

### commentary on ## § 2-203. Seals Inoperative. 


This law section is basically stating that putting a seal on a contract or offer related to buying or selling goods doesn't make it a 'sealed instrument', and thus the laws related to sealed instruments don't apply to such contracts or offers.

So, imagine sending a sealed letter in the old days. The seal on the envelope had certain legal implications - it signified authenticity, authority, and intention. But this section is saying that if you're making a deal to buy or sell goods, putting a seal on the contract doesn't give it any special status or protections under the law. It's just like any other contract of sale.

In other words, this isn't like a scene from a medieval movie where a wax seal on a scroll has some dramatic significance. Here, a seal is just a decoration, not a legal game-changer. 

There's no timeline events or commonly referred counterparts for this law, it's more a clarification of legal procedure and symbol usage within contract law.

### commentary on ## § 2-204. Formation in General.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with contract formation in general. It stipulates that a contract for the sale of goods can be formed in any way that demonstrates an agreement. This can include actions taken by both parties that acknowledge the contract's existence. Furthermore, a contract may be valid even if the exact moment of its formation is not determined.

Importantly, the section also highlights that a contract will not be deemed invalid if one or more terms are left open, as long as there is a clear intention to form a contract and a reasonably certain basis to provide a suitable remedy. This section underlines the flexibility of UCC in facilitating commercial transactions, acknowledging that not all terms of a contract may be finalized at the time of agreement. 

In essence, this section is saying: "You don't need a formal ceremony or a specific moment to make a sale contract. You just need signs that both parties agree to it. And don't worry if some details aren't fixed yet. As long as you both want to make a deal and there's a fair way to sort out any issues, you've got a contract."

An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

§ 2-206. Offer and Acceptance in Formation of Contract. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-205. Firm Offers.


This section of the law, often referred to as the "Firm Offer Rule," pertains to commercial transactions involving the sale of goods. Essentially, if a merchant (or business) makes a written offer to buy or sell goods and provides assurance that the offer will be held open for a certain period of time, that offer cannot be revoked due to a lack of consideration.

Consideration here refers to something of value (usually money) that is given in exchange for something else (in this case, the offer to buy or sell goods). So, despite the absence of this exchange of value, the offer cannot be retracted within the stipulated time, or if no time is given, within a reasonable time.

However, the irrevocable period cannot exceed three months, regardless of what was initially stated or agreed upon. Furthermore, if the offer was made on a form supplied by the offeree (the person to whom the offer was made), the offeror (the one making the offer) must sign separately to indicate their assurance.

This law is in place to ensure fair practices in commercial transactions and to provide a degree of security and predictability for both parties involved. It prevents situations where an offer can be retracted unexpectedly, potentially causing financial or other forms of harm.

§ 2-207. Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-206. Offer and Acceptance in Formation of Contract.


This section outlines the rules regarding offers and acceptances in creating a contract. Specifically, it states that:

1. An offer to make a contract is generally considered as an invitation to accept in any reasonable manner unless specified otherwise.
2. An offer to buy goods for immediate or current shipment can be accepted either by quickly promising to ship the goods, or by actually shipping the goods. However, if the goods shipped are not what was agreed upon, it's not considered an acceptance if the seller lets the buyer know in a timely manner that they're only providing these items as a favor.
3. If the start of the performance requested is a reasonable way of accepting the offer, and the person making the offer doesn't hear back within a reasonable amount of time, they can consider the offer to be expired before being accepted.

In simpler terms, this section is saying: "If you offer to make a deal, you're basically asking someone to say yes in any way that makes sense given the situation. If you order goods for quick delivery, promising to ship or shipping the goods counts as saying yes. But if you ship the wrong goods, it's not saying yes if you tell the buyer you're just trying to help out. And if starting the work is a logical way of saying yes, but you don't hear back in a reasonable amount of time, you can consider the offer expired."

This section is similar to the common law "mirror image rule," which states that an acceptance must precisely match the offer, and the UCC's "mailbox rule," which states that an acceptance is effective when sent.


---

## § 2-207. Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation.


Primary tabs







(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchantssuch terms become part of the contract unless:(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;(b) they materially alter it; or(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for salealthough the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this Act.

### commentary on ## § 2-207. Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with an acceptance of an offer that includes additional or different terms from those initially offered or agreed upon. 

1) It states that an acceptance is still valid, even if it includes additional or different terms, unless it is explicitly made conditional on the new terms. This would be like if you offer to sell your car for $5,000, and the buyer agrees, but only if you include a set of new tires. If you don’t expressly agree to the new terms, the buyer’s acceptance is still valid.

2) This section also clarifies how to treat those additional terms. They are seen as proposals for addition to the contract. However, if you are both merchants, those additional terms become part of the contract unless you explicitly limited acceptance to your initial terms, they materially change the terms of the contract, or you've already rejected or reject them within a reasonable time frame. 

3) Finally, it states that even if there are disagreements in the writings of the parties, if both parties act as if there is a contract (e.g., you hand over the car keys, and the buyer hands over the cash), then a contract exists. The terms of that contract would be the terms the parties agreed on, along with any additional terms that are part of the UCC. 

To put it in layman's terms, this section is saying that if you accept an offer but try to add some extra conditions, your acceptance is still valid unless you said it was conditional on those extras. And if you're both in business, those extras might even become part of the deal, unless they're a big change or have been rejected. Also, if you both act like there's a deal, then there is a deal, regardless of what the paperwork says.

Primary tabs







(1) Where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.(2) The express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade (Section 1-205).(3)Subject to the provisions of the next section on modification and waiver, such course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.

### commentary on ## § 2-208. Course of Performance or Practical Construction.


This section discusses how repeated actions by either party in a contract, especially when the other party does not object, can be used to interpret the agreement's meaning. The law tries to reconcile any differences between the written agreement and the parties' actions, but prioritizes the written terms if a reconciliation is not possible. This section also emphasizes that such repeated actions can indicate a change or waiver of certain contract terms.

Analogy: It's like a sports team that has a set playbook but tends to deviate from it during actual games. If the coach doesn't object, those deviations become a part of the team's effective strategy. However, if there's a conflict between the game plan and the playbook, the playbook reigns supreme.

Timeline Events: 
1. Contract is signed between two parties.
2. One or both parties behave in a certain way repeatedly during the performance of the contract.
3. The other party doesn't object to this behavior.
4. The behavior becomes a part of the interpretation of the contract.

Commonly Referred Counterparts: 
This law is closely related to § 2-207 and § 2-209, which deal respectively with additional terms in acceptance or confirmation and modification, rescission, and waiver in a contract.

## § 2-209. Modification, Rescission and Waiver.


Primary tabs







(1) An agreement modifying a contractwithin this Article needs no consideration to be binding.(2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchantmust be separately signed by the other party.(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2-201) must be satisfied if the contractas modified is within its provisions.(4)Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.(5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contractmay retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

### commentary on ## § 2-209. Modification, Rescission and Waiver.


This section outlines how contracts can be altered, nullified or disregarded without necessarily requiring an additional consideration or trade-off. 

1) Any changes made to a contract do not require an exchange of something of value to be legally binding. 

2) If there's a written agreement that states any changes or termination of the contract must also be in writing, that rule cannot be bypassed. However, non-merchants must sign a separate acknowledgement of this rule in contracts provided by merchants. 

3) If any modifications bring the contract under the purview of the "statute of frauds" (a rule requiring certain contracts to be in writing), then those modifications must adhere to those requirements.

4) Attempts to change or cancel a contract that do not meet the specified standards can still be regarded as a waiver of the contract. 

5) If a party has chosen to ignore or forgo certain aspects of the contract, they can reverse this decision by reasonably notifying the other party that they will be enforcing all terms of the contract. This can only be done if the reversal doesn't unfairly disadvantage the other party who may have made significant changes based on the initial waiver. 

Think of it like remodeling your house - you don't necessarily need to provide anything in return for the changes, but any changes need to be in writing if that's what you agreed to. Also, any major changes that require legal documentation (like a building permit) need to comply with that. And if you tried to make changes but didn't follow the rules, it's like you decided not to remodel at all. However, you can change your mind about not remodeling by telling the contractor, as long as the contractor hasn't already begun demolition based on your initial decision.

Primary tabs







(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.(2) Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreementotherwise.(3)Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.(4) An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.(5) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Section 2-609).

### commentary on ## § 2-210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights.


This law section clarifies how performance and rights related to a contract might be delegated or assigned.

1) A party can have someone else (a delegate) perform their contractual duties unless the contract specifies otherwise or the other party has a vested interest in the original party performing the duties. Notably, delegation doesn’t free the original party from their contractual responsibilities or any liability for contract breaches.

2) Unless expressly stated in the contract, either the seller or buyer can assign their rights to a third party. Exceptions exist if the assignment substantially changes the duty of the other party, significantly increases the burden or risk, or materially affects their chance of return performance. The right to damages for a breach or for full performance of obligations can be assigned regardless of any agreement to the contrary.

3) Unless otherwise indicated, a clause prohibiting assignment of the contract is usually understood to bar only delegation of the assignor’s performance.

4) When a contract or contractual rights are assigned in broad terms, it is considered both an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties to the assignee, unless specified otherwise. The assignee’s acceptance is deemed a promise to perform the duties, enforceable by the original party or the other party to the contract.

5) If a performance-delegating assignment is made, the original contract’s other party can consider this a reasonable cause for concern and request assurances from the assignee without losing their rights against the original assignor.

This section serves as a transition from the previous section on contract modification and waiver to the next part on general obligations and construction of contracts.

### commentary on ## § 2-301. General Obligations of Parties.


In simple terms, this section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) outlines the basic obligations of both parties in a sales transaction. The seller is expected to transfer and deliver the goods, while the buyer is obligated to accept the delivered goods and pay as per the terms of the contract. 

Analogy: This can be compared to a typical restaurant transaction where the restaurant (seller) is expected to prepare and serve the food (transfer and deliver), while the customer (buyer) is expected to eat the food (accept) and pay the bill (pay in accordance with the contract).

Timeline Events: This general obligation holds throughout the transaction process, from the moment the contract is agreed upon until the goods are delivered and payment is made. 

Counterparts: This UCC section corresponds to similar obligations laid out in other contract law, such as the English Sale of Goods Act, that also stipulates the basic obligations of buyer and seller in a sales transaction. 

The language might seem formal and somewhat opaque, but it’s merely outlining what we intuitively understand about buying and selling. A seller has to give the buyer what they paid for, and a buyer has to pay for what they're getting. Any deviation from these obligations could constitute a breach of contract, opening up the potential for legal consequences.

(1) If the court as a matter of law finds the contractor any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.(2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contractor any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.

### commentary on ## § 2-302. Unconscionable contract or Clause.


This section of the law allows the court to nullify or modify a contract if it was deemed to be unconscionable at the time it was made. Unconscionable refers to a contract or clause that is so unfair and one-sided that it shocks the conscience. Typically, such a contract involves exploitation of a party's lack of choice or bargaining power.

In such situations, the court has three options:

1. It can refuse to enforce the entire contract.
2. It can enforce the contract minus the unconscionable clause.
3. It can limit the application of the unconscionable clause to avoid an unfair result.

When it appears that a contract or some clause in it could be unconscionable, both parties to the contract should be given a fair chance to present evidence about its business context, its purpose, and its effect. This helps the court in making its decision.

For example, if a contract for a loan includes an interest rate that is excessively high and the borrower had no other borrowing options at the time, a court might find the interest rate clause to be unconscionable and could choose to either not enforce the contract or to enforce it without the unfair interest rate. 

This law is designed to prevent unfair business practices and protect parties who may not have equal bargaining power. It provides a safeguard against exploitation and promotes fairness and equity in business dealings.

### commentary on ## § 2-303. Allocation or Division of Risks.


This section essentially says that if the law assigns a particular risk or burden to one party, the parties can agree to change this allocation. They can decide to either transfer the risk entirely to the other party or split the risk or burden between them. 

Analogy: Think of it as a potluck dinner. By default, the host might be expected to provide all the food. But, if agreed upon, guests can share the burden by bringing dishes, or even specific items as per their convenience and agreement.

In a more legal context, this could refer to situations such as liability for damage to goods in transit. By default, the seller might bear this risk until the goods are delivered. But, the buyer and seller could agree that the buyer assumes this risk once the goods leave the seller's premises.

Timeline events or counterparts: This provision is a fundamental principle in contract law and is likely present in some form in most contracts to allow for flexibility and customization to specific situations.

This is a standard clause in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a comprehensive set of laws governing all commercial transactions in the United States. It's designed to provide flexibility in commercial transactions by allowing parties to deviate from the default rules set by the UCC, as long as they mutually agree on the allocation or division of risks.

## § 2-304. Price Payable in Money, Goods, Realty, or Otherwise.









(1) The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goodswhich he is to transfer.
(2) Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller'sobligations with reference to them are subject to this Article, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith.

### commentary on ## § 2-304. Price Payable in Money, Goods, Realty, or Otherwise.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code stipulates that the agreed price in a sales contract can be made payable in various forms, such as money, goods, or an interest in real estate. 

In layman's terms, this implies that when you're buying or selling something, you're not limited to just using money to pay for it. You could, for instance, trade goods or even a portion of real estate as payment. If the agreement involves partial or full payment in goods, then each party becomes a seller of the goods they are providing as part of the transaction.

However, this section also clarifies that only the transfer of goods and the seller's responsibilities regarding them fall under the jurisdiction of this Article. In contrast, the transfer of any interest in real estate involved in the transaction and the obligations related to it do not come under the scope of this Article. In simple terms, if you're trading a car for a piece of land, the rules of this Article will cover your responsibilities related to the car, but not the land.

## § 2-305. Open Price Term.









(1) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for saleeven though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if

(a) nothing is said as to price; or
(b) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or
(c) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.

(2) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.
(3) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contractas cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price.
(4) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the sellermust return any portion of the price paid on account.

§ 2-306. Output, Requirements and Exclusive Dealings. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-305. Open Price Term.


This section outlines the legal implications when parties enter a contract without a set price.

1) Even without a settled price, a contract can be concluded if both parties intend so. In such a scenario, the price would be deemed 'reasonable' at the time of delivery if there's no agreed price, the agreed price is not reached by negotiation, or the agreed market price or standard to be set or recorded by a third party is not done so.

2) If the price is to be determined by either the seller or the buyer, it must be done in good faith.

3) If a price that should've been determined by means other than agreement between the parties isn't because of one party's fault, the other party has the option to either cancel the contract or set a reasonable price.

4) However, if both parties intended to be bound only when the price is fixed or agreed upon and it's not, the contract is void. In such a case, any goods received by the buyer must be returned or, if they can't, they must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery. The seller, too, must return any portion of the price paid.

In simpler terms, this law allows for the creation of sales contracts even when the price isn't settled, under certain conditions. These include setting a reasonable price at delivery, the price being set in good faith, the option to cancel the contract or set a reasonable price if the other party fails to fix the price, and returning goods or payments if the contract turns void due to lack of agreement on price.

## § 2-306. Output, Requirements and Exclusive Dealings.









(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.
(2) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.

§ 2-307. Delivery in Single Lot or Several Lots. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-306. Output, Requirements and Exclusive Dealings.


(1) This section states that an agreement which bases quantity on the seller's output or the buyer's needs should reflect the actual output or needs that arise honestly. However, the quantity should be reasonable and not drastically different from any initial estimates or previous normal output or needs. 

(2) If there's an agreement for exclusive rights to sell a certain product, unless otherwise specified, the seller should put forth their best effort to supply the product, and the buyer should do their best to encourage its sale. 

Analogy: Imagine you and a friend have agreed that you will supply them with all the apples from your tree, and in turn, your friend will sell them at their fruit stand. The quantity supplied should reflect what your tree can realistically produce, not an inflated or drastically reduced amount. Plus, your friend should be actively selling your apples, not leaving them to rot.

Common Counterparts: These rules are similar to exclusivity agreements in other industries such as publishing, where a writer might agree to produce a certain number of books for a publisher, or in distribution deals where a supplier agrees to provide a certain product exclusively to one retailer.

Timeline Events: These rules become relevant when one party claims a breach of an exclusivity agreement. For instance, a seller might claim that the buyer isn't putting in enough effort to sell the product, or a buyer might claim that the seller isn't supplying enough of the product.

Takeaway: This section maintains a balance in exclusive dealings by ensuring that both parties act in good faith and fulfill their responsibilities to the best of their abilities.

### commentary on ## § 2-307. Delivery in Single Lot or Several Lots.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) states that unless there is an agreement to the contrary, all goods that are part of a sales contract must be delivered in one go. The payment is due only when this delivery is made. However, if for some reason, the delivery can be split into several smaller lots (for instance, if it would be more convenient or if the goods are being produced in stages), the seller may demand payment for each lot as it is delivered.

In simpler terms, think of it as ordering a pizza with multiple toppings. Normally, you would expect the pizza to come in one piece with all toppings on it. You would only pay once the pizza has been delivered. But if for some reason, they have to deliver each topping separately, they can ask you to pay for each topping as it arrives.

Or consider a scenario where you have ordered 10 handmade chairs. The seller may, in this case, deliver the chairs as they are finished and ask for payment for each chair as it is delivered. This section basically allows the flexibility of splitting up the delivery and payment, depending on the circumstances surrounding the sale.

### commentary on ## § 2-308. Absence of Specified Place for Delivery.


This law discusses how the place of delivery for goods is determined in a contract. If not otherwise specified, the default location is assumed to be the seller's place of business, or their residence if they don't have a business place. However, if the goods being sold are known to be in a different location at the time of the contract, then that location becomes the place of delivery. Additionally, the law allows for the delivery of title documents through regular banking channels.

This law is like the default setting on a GPS – unless you specify a different destination, it'll just direct you to the address associated with the business. But if you and the GPS both know that the item you want isn't at the business address but somewhere else, then that other place becomes your destination. Also, the law acknowledges that most people send important documents like titles through their bank, so that's allowed too.

A significant event related to this law could be a contract where the goods are being stored in a warehouse or other location that isn't the seller's regular place of business. In such a case, the warehouse becomes the place of delivery according to this rule. 

A common counterpart to this law in daily life could be an online purchase, where the delivery address defaults to the one registered with your account unless you specify a different one.

(2) Where the contractprovides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party.

### commentary on ## § 2-309. Absence of Specific Time Provisions; Notice of Termination.


This section details what happens when a contract does not specify a timeline for its obligations. 

1) It states that if a contract does not provide a specific time for shipment, delivery, or any other action, then those actions should be completed within a ‘reasonable time’. What constitutes a reasonable time is not defined here and may be subject to interpretation.

2) In the case of contracts that necessitate successive performances (for example, a subscription service or ongoing maintenance agreement) but do not specify a duration (i.e., when the contract will end), the contract is considered valid for a reasonable period. Either party can terminate the contract at any time, unless they have agreed otherwise.

3) The final part of this section emphasizes that one party can only terminate a contract upon the occurrence of an agreed event and must give reasonable notice to the other party. Any agreement that dispenses with this need for notification is considered invalid if it would be unconscionable, or excessively unfair, to one party. 

In essence, this section provides some protection for parties in a contract that lacks specific time provisions, ensuring that obligations are met within a reasonable time and that the contract can be terminated fairly.

### commentary on ## § 2-310. Open Time for Payment or Running of Credit; Authority to Ship Under Reservation.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines the rules for when payment is due for goods, depending on the conditions of delivery and shipment. 

(a) The default rule is that payment is due when and where the buyer receives the goods, even if they are shipped from the place of delivery.
(b) If the seller is allowed to send the goods, they can hold onto the ownership rights (ship under reservation) until payment is received. The buyer has the right to inspect the goods after they arrive, prior to payment, unless the contract states otherwise.
(c) If the delivery is made via documents of title, meaning the ownership rights to the goods are transferred via paper or electronic documents, payment is due when and where the buyer gets those documents, regardless of where the actual goods are received.
(d) If the seller is required to send the goods on credit, the credit period starts when the goods are shipped. However, if the invoice is post-dated or its dispatch delayed, the credit period's start will also be delayed.

To put it in simpler terms, this section regulates when you have to pay for stuff you buy, depending on how and when it's delivered to you. It also covers cases when the seller sends the goods on credit and what happens if the invoice is delayed.

## § 2-311. Options and Cooperation Respecting Performance.









(1) An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (subsection (3) of Section 2-204) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties. Any such specification must be made in good faithand within limits set by commercial reasonableness.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed specifications relating to assortment of the goods are at the buyer's option and except as otherwise provided in subsections (1)(c) and (3) of Section 2-319 specifications or arrangements relating to shipment are at the seller'soption.
(3)Where such specification would materially affect the other party's performance but is not seasonably made or where one party's cooperation is necessary to the agreed performance of the other but is not seasonably forthcoming, the other party in addition to all other remedies

(a) is excused for any resulting delay in his own performance; and
(b) may also either proceed to perform in any reasonable manner or after the time for a material part of his own performance treat the failure to specify or to cooperate as a breach by failure to deliver or accept the goods.

### commentary on ## § 2-311. Options and Cooperation Respecting Performance.


This section pertains to the details of performance in a sales contract. 

1) A contract is not invalid if it leaves some aspects of performance to be specified by one of the parties, as long as the specifications are made in good faith and within commercially reasonable limits. 

2) Unless otherwise agreed, decisions regarding the assortment of goods are at the discretion of the buyer, and decisions or arrangements related to shipping are at the discretion of the seller, unless otherwise specified. 

3) If the specification affects the other party's performance and is not made at an appropriate time, or if one party's cooperation is needed for the other to perform their part of the contract and is not provided in a timely manner, the other party has the right to delay their own performance, perform in a reasonable manner, or treat the lack of specification or cooperation as a failure by the other party to deliver or accept the goods. 

This section seems to highlight the importance of clear communication and cooperation in contract performance, and allows for flexibility in how parties can respond to delays or failures in specification or cooperation.

## § 2-312. Warranty of Title and Against Infringement; Buyer's Obligation Against Infringement.









(1) Subject to subsection (2) there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the sellerthat

(a) the title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and
(b) the goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.

(2) A warranty under subsection (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyerreason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyerwho furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.

### commentary on ## § 2-312. Warranty of Title and Against Infringement; Buyer's Obligation Against Infringement.


This section of the law provides a set of guarantees or 'warranties' that a seller must provide to a buyer in a sales contract. 

(1) The first subsection states that, unless otherwise specified, a sales contract comes with the warranty that the seller has the legal right to sell the item (i.e., they hold the 'title' to the goods), that they have the right to transfer this title to the buyer, and that the goods will be delivered without any liens or other claims (e.g., mortgage, unpaid debts) against them, as long as the buyer was not aware of these at the time of the contract.

(2) The second subsection explains that this warranty can be waived or changed, but only if the contract includes specific language to this effect or if the circumstances would lead a reasonable buyer to understand that the seller does not actually own the goods or is only selling whatever ownership rights they, or a third party, may have.

(3) The final subsection declares that, unless the contract states otherwise, a seller who is a regular dealer of the type of goods being sold warrants that the goods will be delivered without the risk of any third party making a legal claim to them (e.g., for copyright infringement). However, if the buyer gives the seller specific specifications for the goods, the buyer must protect the seller against any legal claims that may arise from the seller following these specifications.

In layman's terms, this law protects buyers from unknowingly purchasing stolen goods or goods with unsettled financial claims against them. It can be waived or altered, but only if the buyer knows or should know about the issues. It also helps protect sellers who are following the buyer's specific requests from any resulting legal issues.

## § 2-313. Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise, Description, Sample.









(1) Express warranties by the sellerare created as follows:

(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goodsand becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
(b) Any description of the goodswhich is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
(c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.

(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant" or "guarantee" or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goodsor a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

### commentary on ## § 2-313. Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise, Description, Sample.


This section explains how a seller creates express warranties. 

Express warranties are formed when:
(a) The seller makes any affirmation of fact or promise related to the goods that becomes a part of the basis of the deal. This creates a warranty that the goods will be as affirmed or promised.
(b) The seller provides a description of the goods that becomes part of the basis of the deal. This creates a warranty that the goods will match the description.
(c) The seller provides a sample or model that becomes part of the deal. This creates a warranty that the goods will match the sample or model.

The section specifies that a seller doesn’t need to use formal words like “warrant” or “guarantee” to create an express warranty, and that simply stating the value of the goods or offering an opinion or praise of the goods doesn’t create a warranty. 

In simpler terms, if a seller makes a promise about a product, describes it in a certain way, or provides a sample, they're making an express warranty. They don't have to use specific words for it to count as a warranty, but simply praising or valuing a product doesn't count as one.

This section is followed by the section that discusses implied warranties, which are those that aren't stated but are assumed in certain commercial transactions.

## § 2-314. Implied Warranty: Merchantability; Usage of Trade.









(1) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2-316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchantwith respect to goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.
(2) Goodsto be merchantable must be at least such as

(a) pass without objection in the trade under the contractdescription; and
(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and
(c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goodsare used; and
(d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and
(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreementmay require; and
(f) conform to the promise or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.

(3) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2-316) other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.

### commentary on ## § 2-314. Implied Warranty: Merchantability; Usage of Trade.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) establishes the concept of an "implied warranty of merchantability" that applies when a seller, who is a merchant dealing with the type of goods in question, sells goods. 

An implied warranty is an assurance that the product will meet certain quality and performance standards, even if these are not explicitly stated in a contract. An implied warranty of merchantability guarantees that goods are of a standard quality and are fit for the general purpose they were intended for.

This section outlines a number of criteria that goods must meet in order to be considered merchantable. They must:

(a) pass without objection in the trade based on the contract description;
(b) in the case of interchangeable goods, be of fair average quality;
(c) be fit for their usual purposes;
(d) match the kind, quality, and quantity specified in the agreement;
(e) be properly packaged and labeled as required by the agreement; and
(f) match any promises or facts stated on the container or label.

In addition, this section indicates that other implied warranties may apply, based on the course of dealing between the parties or customary practices in the trade, unless these are explicitly excluded or modified under Section 2-316 of the UCC.

This section essentially ensures that a buyer has the right to receive goods that meet basic industry standards and are fit for their usual purposes, unless this warranty is specifically excluded in the sales agreement.

## § 2-315. Implied Warranty: Fitness for Particular Purpose.









Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyeris relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.




‹ PART 3. GENERAL OBLIGATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF CONTRACT

§ 2-316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-315. Implied Warranty: Fitness for Particular Purpose.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code is referring to the concept of an "implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose." This comes into play when a buyer relies on a seller's expertise or knowledge to choose a product for a specific purpose. For example, if a customer goes to a hardware store and tells the salesperson they need a drill for a specific kind of job and the salesperson recommends a particular drill, there is an implied warranty that the drill will be fit for that specific purpose.

Essentially, this law says that if a seller knows a buyer is relying on them to select a product for a certain purpose, the seller is implicitly guaranteeing that the product will be suitable for that purpose. If the product is not, the buyer may be able to return it or seek damages.

This protection can be waived or altered under certain conditions, as outlined in the next section of the code. 

In other words, this is like ordering a burger at a restaurant for the purpose of eating, and expecting it to be edible. If the chef knowingly serves you a plastic display burger instead of a real one, they've breached this implied warranty. Or if you tell a car dealer you need a vehicle that can tow a boat, but the car they sell you can't actually do that, they've breached the warranty. In both cases, you were relying on their expertise to select the right product for your specific needs. 

However, keep in mind that this law can be tricky and may not apply in all cases, depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction. Also, this law doesn't protect buyers from their own poor choices - if you ignore the seller's advice or don't provide enough information about what you need, the warranty might not apply.

## § 2-316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties.









(1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (Section 2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.
(2)Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."
(3)Notwithstanding subsection (2)

(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer'sattention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and
(b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goodsor the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and
(c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.

(4) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions of this Article on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (Sections 2-718 and 2-719).

### commentary on ## § 2-316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties.


This section outlines the conditions for the exclusion or modification of warranties in a contract. 

1. Express warranties and words attempting to limit or negate a warranty should be interpreted as consistent with each other, unless it is unreasonable to do so. Discrepancies between the two are disregarded according to the rules on parol or extrinsic evidence.

2. The implied warranty of merchantability, or its parts, can only be excluded or modified if the language specifically mentions merchantability and must also be conspicuous if in writing. The same rule applies for the exclusion or modification of any implied warranty of fitness, with the exclusion also needing to be in writing and conspicuous. The exclusion may simply state, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."

3. Notwithstanding the above, all implied warranties can be excluded with phrases like "as is", "with all faults", or similar language that draws the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes it clear that there is no implied warranty. Furthermore, if the buyer has examined the goods or sample as fully as he wanted or refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty for defects that should have been revealed during examination. An implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by a course of dealing, performance, or usage of trade.

4. Remedies for warranty breaches can be limited according to the provisions of this article on the liquidation or limitation of damages and on the contractual modification of remedy. 

In simpler terms, this section sets the rules for how warranties can be excluded or modified in a contract and how breaches of warranty can be remedied. These rules protect both buyers and sellers by providing clear guidelines on what is required to exclude or modify warranties and how to handle disputes about warranty breaches.


---

## § 2-317. Cumulation and Conflict of Warranties Express or Implied.









Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if such construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties shall determine which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:

(a) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.
(b) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.
(c) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

### commentary on ## § 2-317. Cumulation and Conflict of Warranties Express or Implied.


This section highlights how warranties, both express and implied, are to be interpreted when they appear to conflict with one another. 

If it is possible, these warranties should be seen as harmonious and cumulative - adding to, not negating, each other. However, if this perspective is unreasonable given the specifics of the agreement, the intention of the parties involved should dictate which warranty holds more weight. 

To ascertain this intention, the following guidelines are given:

(a) Precise technical specifications will override any inconsistent samples, models, or general descriptive language.
(b) A sample taken from an existing larger quantity will override any conflicting general descriptive language.
(c) Explicitly given warranties will override any conflicting implied warranties, barring an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. 

In summary, this section outlines the hierarchy of warranties and provides rules for resolving conflicts between express and implied warranties. It establishes a clear preference for specific and explicit warranties over general descriptions and implied warranties. However, it maintains the primacy of any implied warranty of fitness for a specific purpose, reflecting a priority for warranties directly related to the product's functionality for its intended use.

[Note: If this Act is introduced in the Congress of the United States this section should be omitted. (States to select one alternative.)]
Alternative A
A seller's warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goodsand who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.
Alternative B
A seller's warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume or be affected by the goodsand who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.
Alternative C
A seller's warranty whether express or implied extends to any person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume or be affected by the goodsand who is injured by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section with respect to injury to the person of an individual to whom the warranty extends.

### commentary on ## § 2-318. Third Party Beneficiaries of Warranties Express or Implied.


The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-318 pertains to the extension of a seller's warranty, either express or implied, to third parties. This section provides three alternative provisions for states to choose from, each with varying degrees of protection for third parties. 

Alternative A provides the most limited protection, extending the warranty only to a natural person who is in the family or household of the buyer or a guest in their home. It applies when it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods, and is injured in person by breach of the warranty.

Alternative B is broader, extending the warranty to any natural person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods, and is injured in person by breach of the warranty.

Alternative C provides the most comprehensive protection, extending the warranty to any person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods, and is injured by breach of the warranty. 

In all alternatives, a seller cannot exclude or limit the operation of this section. 

To put it in simpler terms, this section states that if you buy a product, and it fails or causes harm, not only can you sue for damages, but so can anyone else who got hurt by the product, even if they didn't buy it themselves. However, the degree of this protection varies based on which alternative the state chooses. 

In terms of timeline events, the UCC § 2-318 was amended in 1966, presumably to clarify or expand the protection offered to third parties.

(1)Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means "free on board") at a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which

(a) when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2-504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or
(b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2-503);
(c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this Article on the form of bill of lading (Section 2-323).

(2) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means "free alongside") at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the sellermust

(a) at his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer; and
(b) obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (1)(a) or (c) or subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing date. The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this Article (Section 2-311). He may also at his option move the goodsin any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.
(4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goodsin substitution for the documents.

### commentary on ## § 2-319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms.


This section outlines the specifications of the terms F.O.B. ("free on board") and F.A.S. ("free alongside") in commercial transactions. 

When a transaction is marked as F.O.B., the seller is responsible for all risks and costs associated with delivering the goods to a specified location. If the F.O.B. location is the place of shipment, the seller's responsibility ends once the goods are given to the carrier. If the F.O.B. location is the place of destination, the seller bears the risk and cost of transport until the goods reach the destination. For F.O.B. vessel, car, or other vehicle, the seller also has to load the goods on board. 

The F.A.S. term means that the seller must deliver the goods alongside a vessel at a port chosen by the buyer. The seller also must obtain and tender a receipt for the goods, in exchange for which the carrier will issue a bill of lading.

In both F.O.B. and F.A.S. situations, the buyer has to provide necessary instructions for delivery, and any failure to do so could be considered a lack of cooperation. 

For F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S., unless otherwise agreed, the buyer has to make payment against the tender of required documents and neither the seller nor the buyer can substitute the delivery of goods for these documents. 

This section is essentially a guidebook for transactions that utilise the F.O.B. and F.A.S. terms, outlining the responsibilities and expectations for both sellers and buyers.

## § 2-320. C.I.F. and C. &amp; F. Terms.









(1) The term C.I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goodsand the insurance and freight to the named destination. The term C. & F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the sellerat his own expense and risk to

(a) put the goodsinto the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and
(b) load the goods and obtain a receiptfrom the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and
(c) obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the sellermay add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and
(d) prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and
(e) forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due form and with any indorsement necessary to perfect the buyer's rights.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term C. & F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the sellerthe same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance.
(4) Under the term C.I.F. or C. & F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goodsin substitution for the documents.

### commentary on ## § 2-320. C.I.F. and C. &amp; F. Terms.


This section discusses the terms C.I.F. (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) and C. & F. (Cost and Freight), which are commonly used in international trade contracts. 

When a contract is made under the C.I.F. terms, it means that the seller is responsible for arranging and paying for the cost of the goods, insurance, and freight to the agreed destination. Similarly, under the C. & F. terms, the seller is responsible for the cost of the goods and freight, but not the insurance. 

The obligations of the seller under these terms include putting the goods into the possession of a carrier, obtaining necessary documents including a bill of lading and a policy or certificate of insurance, and forwarding these documents to the buyer with commercial promptness. 

The buyer, on the other hand, is obliged to make payment against the tender of these required documents. Neither the buyer can demand delivery of the goods in place of the documents, nor the seller can tender the goods instead of the documents, unless otherwise agreed. 

In other words, in C.I.F. and C. & F. contracts, the goods are essentially replaced by documents that represent them, and the transaction is completed through the exchange of these documents.

Under a contractcontaining a term C.I.F. or C. & F.
(1)Where the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to "net landed weights", "delivered weights", "out turn" quantity or quality or the like, unless otherwise agreed the seller must reasonably estimate the price. The payment due on tender of the documents called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness.
(2) An agreement described in subsection (1) or any warranty of quality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for saleor delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss.
(3)Unless otherwise agreed where the contract provides for payment on or after arrival of the goods the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as is feasible; but if the goods are lost delivery of the documents and payment are due when the goods should have arrived.

### commentary on ## § 2-321. C.I.F. or C. &amp; F.: "Net Landed Weights"; "Payment on Arrival"; Warranty of Condition on Arrival.


This section of the law breaks down the implications and responsibilities of using "Cost, Insurance, and Freight" (C.I.F) or "Cost and Freight" (C. & F.) terms in a contract. 

In the first part, it talks about how the seller should reasonably estimate the price if it is based on factors like "net landed weights", "delivered weights", "out turn" quantity or quality or the like. The estimated amount is due on tender of the necessary documents, but a final price adjustment must be made promptly later.

The second subsection of this section stipulates that the seller assumes the risk of regular transportation losses like deterioration and shrinkage when there's an agreement on the quality or condition of the goods upon arrival. However, this doesn't change the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or affect the risk of loss.

Lastly, if the contract requires payment upon or after the arrival of the goods, the seller must allow for preliminary inspection before payment, if possible. If the goods get lost, the delivery of the documents and payment should happen when the goods should have arrived. 

In simpler terms, this section outlines the general rules to be followed when goods are being bought and sold on CIF or C&F terms. It covers how the price should be estimated, who bears the risk of transportation losses, and what happens if goods are lost in transit.

## § 2-322. Delivery "Ex-Ship".









(1) Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods"ex-ship" (which means from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to a particular ship and requires delivery from a ship which has reached a place at the named port of destination where goods of the kind are usually discharged.
(2)Under such a term unless otherwise agreed

(a) the seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and
(b) the risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.

### commentary on ## § 2-322. Delivery "Ex-Ship".


This section pertains to the delivery term "ex-ship," which usually means goods are delivered from the vessel that carried them. Here are two key points:

1. The term "ex-ship" is not limited to a specific ship. It requires delivery from any ship that has reached the typical discharge location at the specified destination port.

2. Unless otherwise agreed:

   a. The seller is responsible for settling all liens (financial claims) resulting from the carriage. The seller also needs to provide the buyer with a order that obliges the carrier to deliver the goods.
   
   b. The risk of loss doesn't pass to the buyer until the goods have been properly unloaded from the ship.

In simple terms, "ex-ship" means that the seller is responsible for ensuring the goods reach the specified port and are unloaded properly. The buyer does not assume any risk until the goods are fully unloaded. So, if anything happens to the goods while on the ship or during unloading, the seller is responsible. This clearly defines the responsibilities and risks for both buyer and seller in an "ex-ship" delivery agreement.

## § 2-323. Form of Bill of Lading Required in Overseas Shipment; "Overseas".









(1) Where the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or C. & F. or F.O.B. vessel, the seller unless otherwise agreed must obtain a negotiable bill of lading stating that the goodshave been loaded in board or, in the case of a term C.I.F. or C. & F., received for shipment.
(2) Where in a case within subsection (1) a bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer may demand tender of the full set; otherwise only one part of the bill of lading need be tendered. Even if the agreementexpressly requires a full set

(a) due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this Article on cure of improper delivery (subsection (1) of Section 2-508); and
(b) even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require payment upon furnishing an indemnity which the buyer in good faith deems adequate.

(3) A shipment by water or by air or a contract contemplating such shipment is "overseas" insofar as by usage of trade or agreementit is subject to the commercial, financing or shipping practices characteristic of international deep water commerce.

### commentary on ## § 2-323. Form of Bill of Lading Required in Overseas Shipment; "Overseas".


This section pertains to contracts that involve overseas shipments, specifically those containing terms such as C.I.F., C. & F., or F.O.B. vessel. It outlines the responsibility of the seller to obtain a negotiable bill of lading stating that the goods have been loaded or received for shipment. 

The section also addresses situations where a bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts. Unless specified otherwise, if the documents are not being sent from abroad, the buyer can demand the entire set. However, if the documents are being sent from abroad, only one part of the bill of lading needs to be tendered. There are exceptions to these rules, such as when a single part is acceptable under the cure of improper delivery rules, or when payment can be required upon providing an adequate indemnity, even if the full set is demanded. 

Finally, the section clarifies that a shipment by water or air or a contract contemplating such a shipment is considered "overseas" if it is subject to international deep water commerce practices, by trade usage or agreement. 

In simpler terms, this section is about the paperwork necessary for sending stuff overseas and ensures there is a record of the goods being loaded for shipment. It also covers what happens if the paperwork is divided into parts and rules for when full or partial paperwork is acceptable.

## § 2-324. "No Arrival, No sale" Term.









Under a term, "no sale no arrival" or terms of like meaning, unless otherwise agreed,

(a) the seller must properly ship conforming goods and if they arrive by any means he must tender them on arrival but he assumes no obligation that the goodswill arrive unless he has caused the non-arrival; and
(b) where without fault of the seller the goods are in part lost or have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract or arrive after the contract time, the buyer may proceed as if there had been casualty to identified goods (Section 2-613).

### commentary on ## § 2-324. "No Arrival, No sale" Term.


This section of the code addresses the contractual agreement of "no arrival, no sale," which pertains to the shipment of goods. The language implies that if the goods do not arrive for any reason, the sale is voided. 

In this agreement, the seller is required to ship the goods, and if they arrive by any means, the seller must tender them upon arrival. However, the seller is not liable if the goods do not arrive, unless he is the cause of their non-arrival.

In a situation where the goods are partially lost or have deteriorated to the point of not conforming to the contract, or if they arrive after the agreed-upon time, the buyer is allowed to treat the situation as if there had been a casualty to the identified goods. This would likely involve invoking an insurance claim or otherwise seeking restitution for the damaged or lost goods.

This condition is common in international shipping where goods are often subjected to various risks during the transit. This clause mainly outlines the seller's responsibilities in such agreements and provides the buyer an option in case of partial loss or significant deterioration of the goods. 

This provision is followed by Section 2-325, which discusses the "Letter of Credit" term, another common instrument in international trade.

## § 2-325. "Letter of Credit" Term; "Confirmed Credit".









(1) Failure of the buyer seasonably to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breach of the contract for sale.
(2) The delivery to seller of a proper letter of credit suspends the buyer'sobligation to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller may on seasonable notification to the buyer require payment directly from him.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term "letter of credit" or "banker's credit" in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term "confirmed credit" means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the seller'sfinancial market.

### commentary on ## § 2-325. "Letter of Credit" Term; "Confirmed Credit".


Simply put, this section talks about the terms 'letter of credit' and 'confirmed credit' in the context of a contract for sale.

1) If a buyer fails to provide a letter of credit as agreed in the contract, it's considered a breach of contract.

2) When the seller receives a proper letter of credit from the buyer, the buyer's responsibility to pay is temporarily suspended. However, if the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller can let the buyer know he needs to pay directly.

3) Unless the contract specifies otherwise, the term 'letter of credit' or 'banker's credit' usually refers to an irrevocable credit issued by a reputable financing agency. If the shipment is international, the agency should also have a good international reputation. 'Confirmed credit' means the agency issuing the credit is also directly obligated to pay and they do business in the seller's financial market.

Primary tabs







(1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is

(a) a "sale on approval" if the goodsare delivered primarily for use, and
(b) a "sale or return" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on saleor return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession.
(3) Where goods are delivered to a person for sale and such person maintains a place of business at which he deals in goods of the kind involved, under a name other than the name of the person making delivery, then with respect to claims of creditors of the person conducting the business the goods are deemed to be on sale or return. The provisions of this subsection are applicable even though an agreementpurports to reserve title to the person making delivery until payment or resale or uses such words as "on consignment" or "on memorandum". However, this subsection is not applicable if the person making delivery

(a) complies with an applicable law providing for a consignor's interest or the like to be evidenced by a sign, or
(b) establishes that the person conducting the business is generally known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goodsof others, or
(c) complies with the filing provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).

(4) Any "or return" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this Article on parol or extrinsic evidence (Section 2-202).

### commentary on ## § 2-326. Sale on Approval and Sale or Return; Consignment Sales and Rights of Creditors.


This section of law refers to transactions where goods may be returned by the buyer even if they meet the terms of the contract. If the goods are primarily for use, the transaction is termed a "sale on approval". If the goods are primarily for resale, it's called a "sale or return". 

The goods are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until they're accepted in a sale on approval. However, in a sale or return, the goods are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession. 

An exception is made when goods are delivered to someone for sale, and that person has a place of business where they deal in the same type of goods under a different name. In such cases, the goods are considered on sale or return regarding creditors' claims. This holds true even if the agreement appears to retain title with the person delivering the goods. 

This subsection doesn't apply if the person delivering the goods complies with laws showing a consignor's interest with a sign, proves that the business person is known to creditors to be engaged in selling goods of others, or complies with filing provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions.

Finally, any "or return" term in a sales contract is to be considered a separate contract for sale as per the statute of frauds section of this law, and contradicts the sale aspect of the contract as per the section on parol or extrinsic evidence. 

In simpler terms, this section is about how "try before you buy" or "sale or return" transactions work legally, and how they're treated differently when it comes to claims from creditors. It also touches upon a type of delivery where the person delivering the goods seems to retain ownership, but legally, the goods are considered on sale or return.

(c) after due notification of election to return, the return is at the seller's risk and expense but a merchant buyer must follow any reasonable instructions.

(2) Under a saleor return unless otherwise agreed

### commentary on ## § 2-327. Special Incidents of Sale on Approval and Sale or Return.


In simpler terms: 

(1) In a sale on approval, the buyer gets to try the goods before officially buying them. The risk of loss and ownership of the goods don't pass to the buyer until they accept the goods. Using the goods for their intended purpose doesn't count as acceptance, but if the buyer doesn't tell the seller in reasonable time that they want to return the goods, it's considered acceptance. If the goods are as described in the contract, accepting any part of them is considered accepting all of them. If the buyer decides to return the goods, the seller is responsible for the risk and cost of the return. However, if the buyer is a merchant, they must follow any reasonable instructions given by the seller.

(2) In a sale or return, the buyer has the option to return all or part of the goods if they're still in largely the same condition. This option must be exercised in reasonable time. The risk and cost of returning the goods fall on the buyer. 

Think of a sale on approval like a test drive - you're not committed until you say you are. And a sale or return is like buying an item with a return policy - you can get your money back, but you'll have to pay for return shipping.

## § 2-328. Sale by Auction.









(1) In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lotseach lot is the subject of a separate sale.
(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goodssold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.
(3) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.
(4) If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller's behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faithbid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale.

### commentary on ## § 2-328. Sale by Auction.


1) In an auction, each individual item or set of items (lot) is considered a separate sale. 

2) The sale is officially complete when the auctioneer declares it so, usually by the fall of a hammer or another customary signal. If someone places a bid while the hammer is falling for the acceptance of a prior bid, the auctioneer can choose either to reopen the bidding process or consider the item sold under the previously accepted bid. 

3) Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all auction sales are carried out with a reserve price. In a sale with a reserve, the auctioneer can remove the item from sale at any point before announcing its sale is complete. If the sale is without reserve, the item cannot be withdrawn after the call for bids has been made unless no one bids on it within a reasonable time frame. Regardless of the type of auction, any bidder can retract their bid until the auctioneer declares the sale complete. However, if a bid is retracted, it does not reinstate any previous bid. 

4) If the auctioneer or the seller knowingly places a bid on the seller's item without giving prior notice that such bids are permitted, the buyer has the right to either void the sale or purchase the item at the price of the last legitimate bid placed before the sale was concluded. This rule does not apply to any bids placed at a forced sale. 

Analogy: 
This is like a game show, where each item is a separate round. The game is over when the host says it is. If someone tries to play after the round is over, the host can decide whether to allow it or not. There is a minimum price unless stated otherwise, and the host can pull the item at any time unless bids have been opened. If no one bids, the host can pull the item. Contestants can change their minds, but that doesn't bring back any previous plays. If the host or producer tries to play without telling everyone it's allowed, contestants can either reject the round or accept the last legitimate play. But in a game of "everything must go," all bets are off.

## § 2-401. Passing of Title; Reservation for Security; Limited Application of This Section.









Each provision of this Article with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goodsexcept where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this Article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:
(1) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (Section 2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this Act. Any retention or reservation by the sellerof the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.
(2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading

(a) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyerbut does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but
(b) if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.

(3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods,

(a) if the selleris to deliver a document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents; or
(b) if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.

(4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale".

### commentary on ## § 2-401. Passing of Title; Reservation for Security; Limited Application of This Section.


This section of the Article details the regulations concerning the passing of title, or ownership, in a contract for the sale of goods. It stipulates that:

1) Title to goods cannot pass before they are identified in the contract, and unless explicitly agreed, the buyer acquires a limited special interest in the goods upon identification. Any reservation of title by the seller is essentially a security interest. Unless stated otherwise in the contract, the title passes from the seller to the buyer as per their agreement.

2) Unless otherwise agreed, the title passes to the buyer when the seller completes their obligations regarding the physical delivery of the goods. This is true even if there is a reservation of a security interest or the document of title is delivered at a different time/place. If the contract requires the seller to send the goods but not deliver them at the destination, the title passes at the time and place of shipment. If the contract requires delivery at the destination, the title passes when tendered there.

3) Unless otherwise agreed, if the delivery is to be made without moving the goods, the title passes when the seller delivers the document of title or, if the goods are already identified and no documents are to be delivered, at the time and place of contracting.

4) If the buyer rejects the goods or revokes acceptance, the title reverts back to the seller. This is not considered a sale.

This section does not apply in cases where the provision refers to title. It forms a part of the broader legal framework that governs title, creditors, and good faith purchasers. It precedes the section that deals with the rights of the seller's creditors against sold goods.


---

## § 2-402. Rights of Seller's Creditors Against Sold Goods.









(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), rights of unsecured creditors of the seller with respect to goods which have been identified to a contract for sale are subject to the buyer's rights to recover the goods under this Article (Sections 2-502 and 2-716).
(2) A creditor of the seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against him a retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated, except that retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification is not fraudulent.
(3) Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the rights of creditors of the seller

(a) under the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9); or
(b) where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a pre-existing claim for money, security or the like and is made under circumstances which under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated would apart from this Article constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.

### commentary on ## § 2-402. Rights of Seller's Creditors Against Sold Goods.


§ 2-402 governs the rights of a seller's unsecured creditors in relation to goods that have been identified to a contract for sale. It stipulates that these rights are subordinate to a buyer's rights to reclaim the goods. However, if it can be proven that the seller fraudulently retained possession of the goods, the creditor can void the sale. The exception to this rule is when a merchant-seller retains possession of the goods in good faith as part of a reasonable commercial practice. 

The article also clarifies that it does not limit the rights of a seller's creditors under the provisions of Article 9 on Secured Transactions. Furthermore, it does not affect the rights of creditors where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in the course of trade, but in satisfaction of a pre-existing claim for money or security, and is done under circumstances that would constitute fraudulent transfer or voidable preference under the law of the state where the goods are located. 

In simpler terms, it's a bit like when you buy a car, but the seller still owes money on it. The rights of the people the seller owes money to (the creditors) come after your rights to get the car you bought. But if the seller was being sneaky and kept the car after selling it to you, the people they owe money to can cancel the sale. Unless, of course, the seller is a car dealer who kept the car for a reasonable time as part of their normal business. And all of this doesn't affect any other rights the people the seller owes money to might have.

## § 2-403. Power to Transfer; Good Faith Purchase of Goods; "Entrusting".









(1) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faithpurchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though

(a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or
(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or
(c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale", or
(d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.

(2) Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyerin ordinary course of business.
(3) "Entrusting" includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goodshave been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.
[Note: If a state adopts the repealer of Article 6-Bulk Transfers (Alternative A), subsec. (4) should read as follows:]
(4) The rights of other purchasers of goodsand of lien creditors are governed by the Articles on Secured Transactions (Article 9) and Documents of Title (Article 7).
[Note: If a state adopts Revised Article 6-Bulk Sales (Alternative B), subsec. (4) should read as follows:]
(4) The rights of other purchasers of goodsand of lien creditors are governed by the Articles on Secured Transactions (Article 9), Bulk Sales (Article 6) and Documents of Title (Article 7).

### commentary on ## § 2-403. Power to Transfer; Good Faith Purchase of Goods; "Entrusting".


Section 2-403 outlines the rules governing the transfer of ownership for goods. 

Paragraph 1 explains that a buyer of goods gets all the transfer rights that the seller had, unless the purchase was for a limited interest. In that case, the buyer only gets the rights equivalent to the purchased interest. Moreover, someone with a voidable title can transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. This applies even when the original transferor was deceived about the purchaser's identity, was paid with a dishonored check, agreed to a cash sale, or was defrauded in a way considered larceny under criminal law.

Paragraph 2 states that if a person entrusts goods to a merchant who deals with that type of goods, the merchant can transfer all the original owner's rights to a regular buyer in the course of business.

Paragraph 3 defines "entrusting" as any delivery or agreement to allow possession of goods, regardless of any conditions between the parties or whether the circumstances of entrustment or disposal of the goods would be considered larceny under criminal law.

Paragraph 4 differentiates between states that have adopted different versions of the Uniform Commercial Code, explaining that the rights of other purchasers of goods and creditors with liens are governed by different Articles of the UCC, depending on whether the state has adopted Article 6 - Bulk Transfers or Revised Article 6 - Bulk Sales. 

In summary, this section provides guidelines for the transfer of ownership rights in goods and explains situations where a person can transfer more rights than they actually have. It also defines the term "entrusting" as it pertains to possession of goods and highlights differences in state law regarding secured transactions, bulk sales, and documents of title.

## § 2-501. Insurable Interest in Goods; Manner of Identification of Goods.









(1) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are non-conforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreementidentification occurs

(a) when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goodsalready existing and identified;
(b) if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contractrefers;
(c) when the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest reason after contracting whichever is longer.

(2) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyerthat the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.
(3)Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.

### commentary on ## § 2-501. Insurable Interest in Goods; Manner of Identification of Goods.


In layman's terms, this section explains when a buyer has an insurable interest in goods, meaning the legal right to insure them. 

1) This can occur when the items in a contract have been identified, even if they are not up to the standard agreed in the contract and the buyer can return or reject them. The identification can be made at any time and in any way that the parties have clearly agreed. If there's no explicit agreement, identification occurs:
- at the time the contract is made, if it is for the sale of already existing and identified goods.
- when goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the seller if the contract is for the sale of future goods.
- when crops are planted or begin growing, or when animals to be sold are conceived, if the contract is for the sale of these items to be delivered within a year or the next normal harvest season.

2) The seller maintains an insurable interest as long as they still have title or security interest in the goods. If the seller is the only one who identified the goods, they can substitute other goods until a default, insolvency, or they notify the buyer that the identification is final.

3) This section does not affect any insurable interest recognized under any other law or statute.

In simple terms, this section is about when a buyer or seller can insure the goods involved in a sale, based on when and how the goods are identified and who holds the title or security interest. It also allows for the seller to substitute goods under certain conditions.

## § 2-502. Buyer's Right to Goods on Seller's Insolvency.


Primary tabs







(1) Subject to subsection (2) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price.(2) If the identification creating his special property has been made by the buyer he acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale.

### commentary on ## § 2-502. Buyer's Right to Goods on Seller's Insolvency.


The buyer's right to goods on the seller's insolvency, as outlined in § 2-502, is interesting to consider. It basically states two things:

1) If a buyer has paid at least a part of the price for goods they have a special property interest in (according to the terms in the previous section) they have the right to recover those goods if the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after the first payment installment. This, however, depends on the buyer's ability to tender any unpaid portion of the price. 

2) The buyer's right to the goods is only valid if the buyer is the one who identified them as such, thus creating this special property. Not only that, but the goods must actually adhere to the sale contract. 

Imagine you've bought a rare, antique table. You've only paid half the price so far when you learn that the seller is going bankrupt. According to this rule, you can get the table anyway if you pay the rest of the price, provided you were the one who identified the table as unique, and if it fits the description in the sales contract. 

It's like pre-ordering a special edition video game, paying half upfront, and then finding out the company is going bust. If you pay the rest of the price, and had identified that edition as special, and it matches your pre-order description, you can still get your special edition game. 

This rule provides a measure of protection for buyers who've invested in unique or special property goods, ensuring they don't lose out completely if the seller goes under.

## § 2-503. Manner of Seller's Tender of Delivery.









(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreementand this Article, and in particular

(a) tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyerto take possession; but
(b) unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.

(2) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the sellercomply with its provisions.
(3) Where the selleris required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.
(4) Where goodsare in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved

(a) tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer'sright to possession of the goods; but
(b) tender to the buyer of a non-negotiable document of title or of a written direction to the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the non-negotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.

(5) Where the contract requires the sellerto deliver documents

(a) he must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this Article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of Section 2-323); and
(b) tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying the documents constitutes non-acceptance or rejection.

### commentary on ## § 2-503. Manner of Seller's Tender of Delivery.


This section outlines the manner in which a seller should tender delivery of goods sold to a buyer. 

According to the regulations, the seller must make the goods available to the buyer at a reasonable time and place, and notify the buyer about the delivery in a manner that allows the buyer to take possession. The seller must also keep the goods available for a time frame that allows the buyer to take delivery. However, the buyer must provide facilities suitable for receiving the goods, unless stated otherwise in the agreement.

When the case involves shipment, the seller must comply with section 2-504. If the seller is required to deliver at a specific location, the seller must comply with the regulations in subsection (1) and present necessary documents as outlined in subsections (4) and (5).

If the goods are held by a third-party and are to be delivered without being moved, the seller must provide a negotiable document of title, or ensure that the third-party acknowledges the buyer's right to the goods. However, providing a non-negotiable document of title or a written instruction to the third-party to deliver the goods can be considered sufficient, unless the buyer objects.

If the contract requires the seller to deliver documents, the documents must be in correct form, and it is sufficient if the tender is made through customary banking channels. However, a decline of a bank draft that accompanies the documents can be considered as non-acceptance or rejection of the tender.

## § 2-504. Shipment by Seller.









Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the contractdoes not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless otherwise agreed he must

(a) put the goods in the possession of such a carrier and make such a contractfor their transportation as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case; and
(b) obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form any document necessary to enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or otherwise required by the agreementor by usage of trade; and
(c) promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.

Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph (c) or to make a proper contractunder paragraph (a) is a ground for rejection only if material delay or loss ensues.

### commentary on ## § 2-504. Shipment by Seller.


This section details the obligations of the seller in a transaction where they are required or authorized to send goods to the buyer, without a specified delivery destination. The seller must reasonably arrange for the goods' transportation considering their nature and other situational elements, obtain necessary documents for the buyer to take possession of the goods, and promptly notify the buyer of the shipment. If the seller fails to notify the buyer or adequately arrange for transportation, the buyer can reject the goods if this results in a significant delay or loss.

An analogy for this could be a person selling an antique vase online. They must find a suitable carrier, considering the fragility of the item, arrange for any necessary paperwork for the buyer to receive the item, and let the buyer know when it's been shipped. If they don't do this, or they choose an inappropriate shipping method, and the vase is damaged or significantly delayed as a result, the buyer can reject it. 

This might be compared to the shipping policy of many online retailers, which outlines the steps they'll take to deliver your purchase and what happens if issues arise with the delivery.

## § 2-505. Seller's Shipment Under Reservation.









(1) Where the seller has identified goods to the contractby or before shipment:

(a) his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the goods. His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller'sexpectation of transferring that interest to the person named.
(b) a non-negotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsection (2) of Section 2-507) a non-negotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession of the bill of lading.

(2) When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goodsto the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document.

up
§ 2-506. Rights of Financing agency. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-505. Seller's Shipment Under Reservation.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with instances where the seller identifies goods to a contract either prior to or during shipment. It provides rules for different types of bills of lading and the security interests they reserve for the seller.

Subsection (1) outlines that if the seller procures a negotiable bill of lading (a type of document used in international trade that guarantees the holder the right to the goods) to his own order, he essentially reserves a security interest in the goods. This means the seller secures a claim on the property until the buyer has paid the goods off in full. However, if the seller gets the bill to the order of a financing agency or the buyer, this only indicates his intention to transfer that interest to the person named in the bill.

Subsection (1)(b) states that a non-negotiable bill of lading to the seller or his nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but does not reserve any security interest if the buyer is named as consignee, even if the seller keeps the bill of lading, unless it's a case of conditional delivery.

Subsection (2) indicates that if the seller ships the goods with the reservation of a security interest and this violates the sale contract, it constitutes an improper contract for transportation. But, this does not affect any rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract or the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document. 

In easier terms, this section is about how the seller can keep a form of "collateral" through different types of shipping documents until the buyer pays in full, and what happens if the seller breaks the rules. The rules are different based on the type of shipping document used.

## § 2-506. Rights of Financing agency.









(1) A financing agency by paying or purchasing for value a draft which relates to a shipment of goods acquires to the extent of the payment or purchase and in addition to its own rights under the draft and any document of title securing it any rights of the shipper in the goods including the right to stop delivery and the shipper's right to have the draft honored by the buyer.
(2) The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith honored or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the buyeris not impaired by subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document which was apparently regular on its face.

§ 2-507. Effect of Seller's Tender; Delivery on Condition. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-506. Rights of Financing agency.


This law explains the rights of a financing agency in relation to a drafted shipment of goods. If the financing agency pays for or purchases the draft, it acquires the rights of the shipper, including the ability to stop delivery and the right to have the draft honored by the buyer. In addition, the financing agency maintains its right to reimbursement, even if defects are later discovered in relevant documents that initially appeared regular.

In simpler terms, this is like a bank that gives a loan for a business transaction. The bank gets the rights of the person who initiates the transaction, and can call a halt to the delivery if necessary. They also still have a right to get their money back, even if they later find out there was something wrong with the papers that were initially okay.

This is a safeguard for financial institutions involved in trade transactions, ensuring they have rights and protections in the event of unforeseen issues or complications.

## § 2-507. Effect of Seller's Tender; Delivery on Condition.









(1) Tender of delivery is a condition to the buyer's duty to accept the goods and, unless otherwise agreed, to his duty to pay for them. Tender entitles the seller to acceptance of the goods and to payment according to the contract.
(2) Where payment is due and demanded on the delivery to the buyer of goods or documents of title, his right as against the sellerto retain or dispose of them is conditional upon his making the payment due.

### commentary on ## § 2-507. Effect of Seller's Tender; Delivery on Condition.


This statute basically outlines the obligations of the buyer and seller in a goods transaction.

(1) The first part states that the seller must first tender the goods to the buyer before the buyer is obligated to accept and pay for them, unless they had agreed differently. Once the seller has tendered the goods, they are entitled to acceptance and payment as per the contract.

(2) The second part explicates that if payment is due and demanded upon delivery of either the goods or the documents of title to the buyer, the buyer's rights to keep or dispose of them rely on him making the due payment.

In simpler terms, the buyer must pay for the goods upon delivery unless otherwise agreed. If the buyer fails to pay, the seller has the right to take back the goods or the documents of title. This section is in place to protect the rights of sellers in a transaction.


---

## § 2-508. Cure by Seller of Improper Tender or Delivery; Replacement.









(1) Where any tender or delivery by the seller is rejected because non-conforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conformingdelivery.
(2) Where the buyer rejects a non-conforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conformingtender.

§ 2-509. Risk of Loss in the Absence of Breach. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-508. Cure by Seller of Improper Tender or Delivery; Replacement.


This section of the law pertains to situations where a seller has made a delivery or tender that is non-conforming, i.e., does not comply with the agreement between the buyer and seller. However, if the time for performance has not expired, the seller has the right to rectify the situation. 

To do this, the seller must notify the buyer within a reasonable time frame of their intention to 'cure' the non-conformance. The seller can then make a new delivery that does conform to the agreement within the contract time.

The second part of this section deals with scenarios where the seller reasonably thought their non-conforming delivery would be acceptable to the buyer, possibly with a money allowance. In such cases, if the buyer rejects the delivery, then the seller can, after informing the buyer in a timely manner, have more time to replace the non-conforming tender with a conforming one.

An analogy for this could be a baker who promises to deliver a chocolate cake but delivers a vanilla one instead. If the delivery time is not yet past, the baker can inform the customer that they intend to replace the wrong cake with the correct one within the agreed time frame. Similarly, if the baker thought the customer would be okay with the vanilla cake and even offers a discount, but the customer still rejects it, the baker can notify the customer and get extra time to deliver the chocolate cake.

This law mainly provides a chance for the seller to rectify any mistakes in the order, which can avoid potential disputes or breaches of contract. It also highlights the importance of clear communication between buyer and seller.


---

## § 2-509. Risk of Loss in the Absence of Breach.









(1) Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goodsby carrier

(a) if it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation (Section 2-505); but
(b) if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.

(2) Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer

(a) on his receipt of a negotiable document of title covering the goods; or
(b) on acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; or
(c) after his receipt of a non-negotiable document of title or other written direction to deliver, as provided in subsection (4)(b) of Section 2-503.

(3) In any case not within subsection (1) or (2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of delivery.
(4) The provisions of this section are subject to contrary agreement of the parties and to the provisions of this Article on sale on approval (Section 2-327) and on effect of breach on risk of loss (Section 2-510).

### commentary on ## § 2-509. Risk of Loss in the Absence of Breach.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) outlines when the risk of loss transfers from the seller to the buyer in various situations when there hasn't been a breach of contract. Essentially, it's all about who bears the responsibility if the goods are damaged or lost before the buyer actually receives them.

1) If a contract allows or requires the seller to ship goods, risk of loss passes to the buyer either when the goods are delivered to the carrier (if no specific destination is required) or when the goods are tendered at the agreed-upon destination (if one is specified).

2) If goods are being held by a third-party (a bailee) and are to be delivered without being moved, risk of loss transfers to the buyer upon the buyer's receipt of a negotiable document of title for the goods, when the bailee acknowledges the buyer's right to possess the goods, or after the buyer receives a non-negotiable document of title or other written delivery directions.

3) In scenarios that don't fall under the above two subsections, the risk of loss passes to the buyer upon the buyer's receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant, or at the time of delivery if the seller isn't a merchant.

4) Despite these guidelines, the seller and buyer can agree to different terms concerning risk of loss. These rules also do not apply in cases of sale on approval or when a breach of contract affects who bears the risk of loss.

In the same way a quarterback passes the ball in a football game, risk of loss is passed from seller to buyer in a transaction. The exact moment of the pass can differ based on the specifics of the play (or in this case, the contract). But remember, just like in football, the parties involved can always draw up a different play (a contrary agreement) if they so choose.

## § 2-510. Effect of Breach on Risk of Loss.









(1) Where a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the contract as to give a right of rejection the risk of their loss remains on the selleruntil cure or acceptance.
(2) Where the buyer rightfully revokes acceptance he may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as having rested on the sellerfrom the beginning.
(3) Where the buyer as to conforming goods already identified to the contract for sale repudiates or is otherwise in breach before risk of their loss has passed to him, the sellermay to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as resting on the buyer for a commercially reasonable time.

### commentary on ## § 2-510. Effect of Breach on Risk of Loss.


This section is essentially about who is responsible if goods are damaged or lost, particularly when there is a breach of contract. It outlines three scenarios:

1) If the goods delivered don't meet the terms of the contract (e.g., they're defective or not what was ordered), and the buyer rejects them, the seller is responsible for any loss or damage until the problem is fixed or the goods are accepted.

2) If the buyer initially accepts the goods but then discovers a problem and revokes acceptance (e.g., the goods are found to be faulty), the buyer can pass the risk of loss back to the seller, but only to the extent that the buyer's insurance doesn't cover the loss.

3) If the goods are as agreed in the contract, but the buyer backs out or breaches the contract before taking responsibility for the goods, the seller can pass the risk of loss to the buyer for a reasonable period of time, but again, only to the extent that the seller's insurance doesn't cover the loss.

This is like selling a car: if the car breaks down before it's delivered, it's the seller's problem, but if the buyer drives it off the lot and then changes their mind, they can't just return a wrecked car to the seller without consequences. Or if the buyer agrees to buy the car but then fails to pick it up, the seller isn't responsible for it forever. In all cases, insurance plays a major role in deciding who bears the cost of damages.

## § 2-511. Tender of Payment by Buyer; Payment by Check.









(1) Unless otherwise agreed tender of payment is a condition to the seller'sduty to tender and complete any delivery.
(2) Tender of payment is sufficient when made by any means or in any manner current in the ordinary course of business unless the sellerdemands payment in legal tender and gives any extension of time reasonably necessary to procure it.
(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act on the effect of an instrument on an obligation (Section 3-802), payment by check is conditional and is defeated as between the parties by dishonor of the check on due presentment.

### commentary on ## § 2-511. Tender of Payment by Buyer; Payment by Check.


This section of the law outlines the conditions under which a buyer must make a payment to a seller. 

1) In most cases, the seller's obligation to deliver the goods is contingent on the buyer's tender of payment. Essentially, the buyer has to pay before the seller is required to complete the delivery. 

2) The mode of payment is also addressed. Payment can be made in any way that is typically accepted in normal business transactions, unless the seller specifically requests legal tender (cash). If this is the case, the seller must also provide the buyer with a reasonable amount of time to secure this form of payment. 

3) The law also stipulates that paying by check is considered a conditional form of payment. If the check is not honored by the bank upon presentation, the payment is deemed to have not occurred, disrupting the transaction between the parties. 

In simpler terms, this law basically provides guidelines for how buyers are supposed to pay sellers in business transactions. It highlights that sellers aren’t required to deliver until they've been paid or have a payment promise, that payment can be made in most forms unless cash is specifically requested, and that payment by check is only valid if the check is honored by the bank.

## § 2-512. Payment by Buyer Before Inspection.









(1) Where the contract requires payment before inspection non-conformity of the goods does not excuse the buyerfrom so making payment unless

(a) the non-conformity appears without inspection; or
(b) despite tender of the required documents the circumstances would justify injunction against honor under the provisions of this Act (Section 5-114).

(2) Payment pursuant to subsection (1) does not constitute an acceptance of goods or impair the buyer'sright to inspect or any of his remedies.




‹ § 2-511. Tender of Payment by Buyer; Payment by Check.
up
§ 2-513. Buyer's Right to Inspection of Goods. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-512. Payment by Buyer Before Inspection.


This section establishes that a contract may require the buyer to make payment before inspecting the goods. However, if the goods are found to be non-conforming, this does not excuse the buyer from making the required payment, unless the non-conformity is evident without inspection, or if, despite the tender of the required documents, circumstances would justify an injunction against honor under the provisions of this Act.

It further clarifies that the buyer making a payment as per the stipulations in subsection (1) does not mean that the buyer has accepted the goods or that it impairs the buyer's right to inspect the goods or any of his remedies.

In layman's terms, this section means that, if a contract says you have to pay before you can check the goods, you still have to pay even if the goods are not up to standard. The exceptions are if the goods are obviously not correct without you needing to check them, or if there are conditions that would allow you to legally avoid paying under this Act. Paying as required doesn't mean you've accepted the goods as they are, nor does it take away any rights or remedies you have.

This section is typically relevant in transactions involving import or export of goods, where goods are often paid for before they are received and inspected by the buyer, especially in cases where Letter of Credit is used as a mode of payment.


---

## § 2-513. Buyer's Right to Inspection of Goods.









(1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the selleris required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.
(2) Expenses of inspection must be borne by the buyer but may be recovered from the seller if the goodsdo not conform and are rejected.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this Article on C.I.F. contracts (subsection (3) of Section 2-321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goodsbefore payment of the price when the contract provides

(a) for delivery "C.O.D." or on other like terms; or
(b) for payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due only after the goods are to become available for inspection.

(4) A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract.

### commentary on ## § 2-513. Buyer's Right to Inspection of Goods.


This section outlines the buyer's rights to inspect goods in a sales contract. 

1) Unless the contract specifies otherwise and with consideration of subsection (3), the buyer has the right to inspect the goods at a reasonable time and place, and in a reasonable manner before payment or acceptance. This right applies if the goods have been delivered or identified in the sales contract. If the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection can take place after their arrival.

2) Although the buyer is responsible for inspection costs, they may be able to recover these costs from the seller if the goods do not conform to the contract and are therefore rejected.

3) There are exceptions to the buyer's right to inspect goods before payment. This right does not apply if the contract provides for delivery "C.O.D." or on similar terms or if the contract requires payment against documents of title, unless such payment is only due after the goods become available for inspection, as outlined in this Article’s provision on C.I.F contracts.

4) Parties can agree on a specific place or method for inspection. This agreement is assumed to be exclusive unless otherwise stated, but it does not affect the identification of goods, delivery or risk transfer. If it becomes impossible to comply with the agreed place or method, the provisions in this section apply unless the agreed place or method was a fundamental condition of the contract, in which case its failure may invalidate the contract.

This section comes after "§ 2-512. Payment by Buyer Before Inspection" and before "§ 2-514. When Documents Deliverable on Acceptance; When on Payment."

## § 2-514. When Documents Deliverable on Acceptance; When on Payment.









Unless otherwise agreed documents against which a draft is drawn are to be delivered to the drawee on acceptance of the draft if it is payable more than three days after presentment; otherwise, only on payment.

§ 2-515. Preserving Evidence of Goods in Dispute. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-514. When Documents Deliverable on Acceptance; When on Payment.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code specifies when documents related to a transaction are given to the drawee (the party who must pay). If the draft (the order to pay) is payable more than three days after it is presented, the documents should be given when the draft is accepted. If the draft is payable in three days or less, the documents should only be given when payment is made, unless there was a different agreement in place.

For instance, if a buyer and a seller agree to a transaction on Monday, and the agreement stipulates that payment will be made on Friday (more than three days later), the seller would give the related documents to the buyer when the buyer accepts the draft on Monday. On the other hand, if the agreement stipulates that payment will be made on Wednesday (less than three days later), the seller would only give the documents to the buyer when the buyer makes the payment on Wednesday. 

This rule is designed to protect sellers from losing their right to payment if they hand over documents (which could include title to the goods) too early. However, the parties can agree to a different arrangement if they wish.

In furtherance of the adjustment of any claim or dispute

(a) either party on reasonable notification to the other and for the purpose of ascertaining the facts and preserving evidence has the right to inspect, test and sample the goodsincluding such of them as may be in the possession or control of the other; and
(b) the parties may agree to a third party inspection or survey to determine the conformity or condition of the goods and may agree that the findings shall be binding upon them in any subsequent litigation or adjustment.

### commentary on ## § 2-515. Preserving Evidence of Goods in Dispute.


This section outlines the rights and obligations of parties involved in a dispute over goods. According to clause (a), either party can, upon reasonable notification to the other, inspect, test, and sample the goods in dispute. This right extends to goods that may be in the possession or control of the other party. The purpose of this right is to ascertain the facts of the dispute and preserve evidence that may be used in a potential litigation.

Clause (b) allows for the parties to agree on a third-party inspection or survey to determine the conformity or condition of the goods. The parties can also agree that the findings of this third-party inspection or survey will be binding upon them in any subsequent litigation or adjustment.

In simpler terms, if you're having a disagreement about goods (like if something you bought is damaged or not what you expected), both sides can check out the goods to see what's really going on. They can even agree to let a neutral third-party inspect the goods and make a decision that they'll both stick to. This is all to make sure that the facts are clear and fair before any big legal battles happen.

Subject to the provisions of this Article on breach in installment contracts (Section 2-612) and unless otherwise agreed under the sections on contractual limitations of remedy (Sections 2-718 and 2-719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyermay

(a) reject the whole; or
(b) accept the whole; or
(c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.

### commentary on ## § 2-601. Buyer's Rights on Improper Delivery.


This section explains the rights of a buyer when an improper delivery of goods happens. The buyer can either reject all goods, accept all goods, or accept some and reject the rest. This is still applicable unless there was an agreement under the contractual limitations of remedy.

In simpler terms, if you buy something and it's not what you ordered or expected, you can either send it all back, keep it all, or keep some of it and send the rest back, unless you've already agreed to different terms in your contract.


---

## § 2-602. Manner and Effect of Rightful Rejection.









(1) Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.
(2) Subject to the provisions of the two following sections on rejected goods (Sections 2-603 and 2-604),

(a) after rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller; and
(b) if the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this Article (subsection (3) of Section 2-711), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller'sdisposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them; but
(c) the buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.

(3) The seller's rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the provisions of this Article on seller's remedies in general (Section 2-703).

### commentary on ## § 2-602. Manner and Effect of Rightful Rejection.


This section is about the process and consequences of rightful rejection of goods. It details the obligations and rights of both the buyer and seller in such instances. 

(1) If a buyer rejects delivered goods, it must be within a reasonable time, and the seller must be informed promptly. 
(2) If the buyer rejects the goods:
(a) any action implying ownership of the goods is considered wrongful,
(b) the buyer must hold and take care of the goods, if he/she has already taken possession of them, long enough for the seller to reclaim them, unless the buyer has a security interest in them,
(c) the buyer has no further obligations towards the rejected goods.

(3) If goods are wrongfully rejected by the buyer, the remedies available to the seller are outlined in Section 2-703.

In simpler terms, if you buy something and it's not what you were expecting, you need to let the seller know quickly and take care of the item until they can come get it. But once you've done that, you're off the hook. On the other hand, if you reject something without a good reason, the seller has rights and remedies outlined elsewhere in the law.


---

## § 2-603. Merchant Buyer's Duties as to Rightfully Rejected Goods.









(1) Subject to any security interest in the buyer (subsection (3) of Section 2-711), when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection a merchant buyer is under a duty after rejection of goodsin his possession or control to follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the goods and in the absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller's account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.
(2) When the buyer sells goods under subsection (1), he is entitled to reimbursement from the selleror out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds.
(3) In complying with this section the buyer is held only to good faithand good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.

### commentary on ## § 2-603. Merchant Buyer's Duties as to Rightfully Rejected Goods.


This section details the responsibilities of a merchant buyer when they reject goods from a seller. 

If the seller has no agent or business location in the market where the goods were rejected, the merchant buyer must follow any reasonable instructions provided by the seller regarding the goods. If no instructions are provided, the merchant buyer must attempt to sell the goods if they are at risk of spoiling or decreasing in value quickly. However, the seller's instructions are not considered reasonable if they do not provide compensation for expenses. 

If the buyer ends up selling the goods, they are entitled to be reimbursed from the seller or from the sale proceeds for any reasonable expenses related to caring for and selling the goods. If no selling commission was included in the expenses, the buyer is entitled to the usual trade commission or a reasonable amount that does not exceed 10% of the gross proceeds.

The buyer is only expected to act in good faith when complying with this section. Acting in good faith does not mean the buyer has accepted the goods, nor does it make the buyer liable for damages. 

The sections before and after this one discuss the manner and effect of rightful rejection and the buyer's options for salvaging rightfully rejected goods.


---

## § 2-604. Buyer's Options as to Salvage of Rightfully Rejected Goods.









Subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding section on perishables if the seller gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection the buyer may store the rejected goodsfor the seller's account or reship them to him or resell them for the seller's account with reimbursement as provided in the preceding section. Such action is not acceptance or conversion.

### commentary on ## § 2-604. Buyer's Options as to Salvage of Rightfully Rejected Goods.


This section provides options for the buyer when the seller has not provided instructions for the disposal of rejected goods within a reasonable time period. If the goods are not perishable, the buyer can store, reship or resell them on behalf of the seller, and seek reimbursement for these actions, as covered in the preceding section. However, these actions do not constitute acceptance of the goods by the buyer or conversion (illegal possession) of the goods.

Analogously, this is like if a friend lends you a sweater you didn't ask for and never tells you what they want you to do with it after you've told them you don't want it. You're allowed to put it in your closet (store), send it back to your friend (reship), or sell it to a thrift store (resell) on your friend's behalf, without it meaning you've accepted the sweater or stolen it. 

A significant timeline event would be the buyer's notification of rejection to the seller. The seller's lack of instructions within a reasonable time after this notification triggers the buyer's right to store, reship, or resell the goods. 

A commonly referred counterpart might be § 2-603, which covers the buyer's duties as to rightfully rejected goods.

## § 2-605. Waiver of Buyer's Objections by Failure to Particularize.









(1) The buyer'sfailure to state in connection with rejection a particular defect which is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes him from relying on the unstated defect to justify rejection or to establish breach

(a) where the sellercould have cured it if stated seasonably; or
(b) between merchants when the seller has after rejection made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the buyer proposes to rely.

(2)Payment against documents made without reservation of rights precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent on the face of the documents.

### commentary on ## § 2-605. Waiver of Buyer's Objections by Failure to Particularize.


This law concerns a buyer’s ability to reject goods based on defects. 

(1) If the buyer fails to state a specific defect when rejecting the goods, they cannot later rely on that same defect to justify their rejection or claim a breach of contract. This is applicable in two situations: (a) the seller could have fixed the defect if it was stated in a timely manner, or (b) in transactions between merchants, if the seller has asked in writing for a comprehensive written list of all defects after the buyer's rejection.

(2) If the buyer makes a payment against documents without any reservation of rights, they cannot later claim a refund for any defects apparent on the face of those documents.

In simpler terms, if a buyer rejects goods due to defects, they need to specify those defects. If they fail to do this, they cannot later claim these undisclosed defects as a reason for the rejection. Additionally, if they pay for goods without raising any objections to apparent defects in the documents, they can't demand their money back later due to these defects.

## § 2-606. What Constitutes Acceptance of Goods.









(1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer

(a) after a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conformingor that he will take or retain them in spite of their non-conformity; or
(b) fails to make an effective rejection (subsection (1) of Section 2-602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyerhas had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or
(c) does any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.

(2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unitis acceptance of that entire unit.

### commentary on ## § 2-606. What Constitutes Acceptance of Goods.


This section defines what constitutes the acceptance of goods by a buyer. 

1. Acceptance can occur in three ways:
   a. The buyer, after a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods, communicates to the seller that the goods are as expected, or that he will keep them despite their flaws.
   b. The buyer fails to effectively reject the goods (as defined in Section 2-602), but this acceptance can only occur after the buyer has had a fair chance to inspect the goods.
   c. The buyer acts in a way that contradicts the seller's ownership, but if this act is considered wrong against the seller, it's only accepted if the seller ratifies it.

2. If a buyer accepts a part of any commercial unit, it is considered as the acceptance of the entire unit.

In simpler terms, this section states that a buyer accepts goods when they either verbally agree to take them, fail to reject them properly, or act in a way that implies ownership. The buyer must have a fair chance to inspect the goods before acceptance, and accepting a portion of a product implies acceptance of the whole.


---

## § 2-607. Effect of Acceptance; Notice of Breach; Burden of Establishing Breach After Acceptance; Notice of Claim or Litigation to Person Answerable Over.









(1) The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goodsaccepted.
(2) Acceptance of goods by the buyerprecludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a non-conformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the non-conformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this Article for non-conformity.
(3)Where a tender has been accepted

(a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the sellerof breach or be barred from any remedy; and
(b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of Section 2-312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.

(4) The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goodsaccepted.
(5) Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which his selleris answerable over

(a) he may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receiptof the notice does come in and defend he is so bound.
(b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of Section 2-312) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.

(6) The provisions of subsections (3), (4) and (5) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (subsection (3) of Section 2-312).

### commentary on ## § 2-607. Effect of Acceptance; Notice of Breach; Burden of Establishing Breach After Acceptance; Notice of Claim or Litigation to Person Answerable Over.


This statute outlines the obligations and rights of a buyer after acceptance of goods under a contract, particularly in cases of non-conformity or breach. 

1) The buyer is required to pay for any goods they have accepted at the contract rate.

2) Once goods are accepted, they cannot be rejected. If a buyer accepts goods knowing they are non-conforming, they can't later revoke acceptance based on this non-conformity, unless they reasonably assumed the seller would fix the issue in a timely manner. Acceptance doesn't affect other remedies for non-conformity under this Article.

3) If a buyer discovers or should have discovered a breach after accepting the goods, they must notify the seller within a reasonable time, or they lose their right to any remedy. This also applies if the buyer is sued due to a breach, such as a claim for infringement.

4) The buyer carries the burden of proving any breach related to the accepted goods.

5) If a buyer is sued for a breach of warranty or something similar for which their seller is liable, they can provide written notice to the seller. If the notice states that the seller can partake in the defence and the seller doesn't, they will be bound by any factual determinations in the litigation. If the claim is for infringement, the original seller can demand control of the litigation, including any settlement, and if the buyer doesn't comply, they lose any right to remedy.

6) These rules also apply if the buyer has an obligation to protect the seller against infringement.

In summary, this section basically says "buyer, beware." After accepting goods, the buyer needs to promptly report any problems, or they risk losing their right to remedies. They also have responsibilities if they wind up in court over the goods they bought.

## § 2-608. Revocation of Acceptance in Whole or in Part.


Primary tabs







(1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it

(a) on the reasonable assumption that its non-conformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or
(b) without discovery of such non-conformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances.

(2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it.
(3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.

§ 2-609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-608. Revocation of Acceptance in Whole or in Part.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) permits a buyer to revoke their acceptance of goods or commercial units that are non-conforming, i.e., not as agreed or expected if these non-conformities considerably reduce the value of the item to the buyer. 

This revocation is permissible in two scenarios: (a) if the buyer initially accepted the goods under the assumption that any issues would be addressed and rectified within a reasonable period, but this hasn't happened, or (b) if the buyer accepted the item without noticing the non-conformity, due to either the difficulty in detecting the issue prior to acceptance or because of assurances given by the seller.

The buyer must revoke their acceptance within a reasonable timeframe after discovering or when they should have reasonably discovered the problem, and before there has been any substantial change to the condition of the goods not caused by their own defects. The revocation only becomes official when the buyer notifies the seller.

Once acceptance is revoked, the buyer has the same rights and obligations as if they initially rejected the goods. This could include seeking a refund, replacement, or repair.

In simpler terms, if you buy something and it turns out to be defective or not as described, and you accepted it initially because you thought the issue would be fixed or because the seller reassured you, you can change your mind and reject the goods. However, you need to do this promptly after discovering the issue and notify the seller, and you can't have significantly altered the state of the goods yourself. Once you revoke your acceptance, you have the same rights as if you never accepted the goods in the first place.


---

## § 2-609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance.









(1) A contract for saleimposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.
(2) Between merchantsthe reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.
(3)Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.
(4) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.

§ 2-610. Anticipatory Repudiation. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance.


This section addresses a party's right to demand assurance of performance if they have reasonable doubts about the other party's ability or willingness to fulfill their obligations under a contract.

1. If a party has valid reasons to believe that the other party may not be able to fulfill its contractual obligations, it may request, in writing, for 'adequate assurance' of performance. The requesting party can also choose to suspend their own performance until they receive such assurance. However, this suspension must be commercially reasonable.

2. For contracts between merchants, what constitutes 'reasonable grounds' for insecurity, and what is considered 'adequate assurance', should align with commercial standards.

3. Accepting an improper delivery or payment doesn't mean the aggrieved party forfeits their right to demand assurance of future performance.

4. If a party fails to provide adequate assurance of performance within 30 days of a justified demand, it is seen as a breach of the contract.

Analogies: If you're selling a car, but the buyer seems shaky about paying, you can demand written proof that they can afford it. If they don't provide it within a reasonable timeframe, you can consider the deal off.

In essence, this law is like an insurance policy for a party in a contract. It allows them to request assurance if they have doubts about the other party, and to suspend their own obligations if these assurances are not provided in a timely manner.

## § 2-610. Anticipatory Repudiation.









When either party repudiates the contractwith respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may

(a) for a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party; or
(b) resort to any remedy for breach (Section 2-703 or Section 2-711), even though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latter's performance and has urged retraction; and
(c) in either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this Article on the seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2-704).





‹ § 2-609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance.

§ 2-611. Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-610. Anticipatory Repudiation.


This law is about anticipatory repudiation, which happens when one party indicates that they may not fulfill their contractual obligations before the due date of performance. This can endanger the whole contract if the expected performance is substantial to the other party.

As per this law, the aggrieved party has the following options:

- They can wait for a commercially reasonable amount of time to see if the repudiating party will perform as promised.
- They can use any appropriate legal remedy for breach of contract. This is possible even if they have previously told the repudiating party that they would wait for their performance and asked them to withdraw their repudiation.
- They can also stop their own performance or proceed as per the law's provisions about the seller's rights in case of breach of contract. This includes the right to identify goods related to the contract or to salvage unfinished goods.

For example, if a builder contracts with a supplier for specific, custom materials needed for a construction project, and the supplier indicates they may not be able to deliver those materials on time, the builder could be substantially impaired by this anticipatory repudiation. Under this law, the builder could choose to wait for a reasonable period, seek legal remedies for breach of contract, or stop their own work till the issue is resolved. 

This law operates as an insurance policy for the non-breaching party, giving them options to protect themselves in the event of a possible breach. It keeps the repudiating party on their toes, since they face potential legal action if they do not perform as promised.


---

## § 2-611. Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation.









(1)Until the repudiating party's next performance is due he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.
(2) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this Article (Section 2-609).
(3) Retraction reinstates the repudiating party's rights under the contractwith due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.

### commentary on ## § 2-611. Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code allows a party who has announced their intention to breach a contract (i.e., anticipatory repudiation) to retract that intention and restore their rights under the contract. However, there are certain conditions:

1) The retracting party can only do so before their next performance is due. They lose this right if the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled the contract, significantly altered their position, or otherwise indicated that they consider the repudiation as final.

2) The retraction must be clear and convincing to the aggrieved party that the retracting party intends to fulfill their contractual obligations. If the aggrieved party has requested any sort of assurance under Section 2-609 of the UCC, the retraction must include this.

3) If the retraction is valid, this restores the rights of the retracting party under the contract. However, the aggrieved party must be compensated for any delay caused by the initial repudiation.

In plain English, if you say you're not going to do something you agreed to in a contract, you can take it back and the contract is back on. But, you must do it before your next obligation is due, and the other party hasn't already acted on your original statement. You must also assure the other party that you'll fulfill the contract, including any specific assurances they ask for. If you do all this, your contract rights are restored, but you may owe the other party for any delay your original statement caused.

## § 2-612. "Installment contract"; Breach.









(1) An "installment contract" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contractcontains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract" or its equivalent.
(2) The buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the sellergives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.
(3) Whenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellationor if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.

### commentary on ## § 2-612. "Installment contract"; Breach.


This law discusses the rules for "installment contracts". These are contracts where goods are delivered in multiple parts with each part expected to be accepted individually. 

Under this law:

1. If a delivered installment is not up to standard, and this significantly reduces the value of that installment to the point where it cannot be fixed, or if there are issues with the required documents, then the buyer has the right to reject that installment. 

2. However, if the seller can give sufficient assurance that they will rectify the problem, then the buyer must accept that installment, unless it falls under the third subsection.

3. If the deficiency or non-compliance in one or more installments is so significant that it affects the value of the entire contract, then it is considered a breach of the whole contract. However, the wronged party can reinstate the contract by either accepting the deficient installment without timely notification of cancellation, or by only taking legal action for past installments, or by demanding performance for future installments. 

To summarize, this law outlines the circumstances under which a buyer can reject an installment and when non-conformity constitutes a breach of the entire contract. It also details the scenarios under which the contract can be reinstated. The aim is to protect both buyer and seller in installment contracts.

## § 2-613. Casualty to Identified Goods.









Where the contract requires for its performance goods identified when the contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of either party before the risk of loss passes to the buyer, or in a proper case under a "no arrival, no sale" term (Section 2-324) then

(a) if the loss is total the contractis avoided; and
(b) if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the contract as avoided or accept the goods with due allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the seller.

§ 2-614. Substituted Performance. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-613. Casualty to Identified Goods.


This section details what happens if goods identified in a contract are damaged or destroyed without the fault of either party involved in the contract before the risk of loss passes to the buyer. This could also apply in the case of a "no arrival, no sale" term.

If the goods are completely lost, the contract is voided. If the goods are partially lost or have deteriorated to the point where they no longer fulfill the contract's requirements, the buyer may still demand an inspection. The buyer can then either void the contract or accept the goods with a fair reduction in the contract's price to account for the damage or the lack of quantity, but cannot hold the seller liable beyond this point. 

In simpler terms, if you ordered a specific painting and it got ruined in transit without anyone's fault, you could either cancel the order or accept the ruined painting at a reduced price, without any further claim against the seller.


---

## § 2-614. Substituted Performance.









(1)Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.
(2) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyerprovides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.




‹ § 2-613. Casualty to Identified Goods.
up
§ 2-615. Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-614. Substituted Performance.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) covers situations where the agreed upon methods of delivery or payment become impossible or impractical through no fault of either party involved in the contract.

Two circumstances are covered:

1) If a party is unable to deliver goods as agreed due to unforeseen circumstances (such as if the agreed shipping carrier is no longer available or the loading/unloading facilities fail), a substitute method that is commercially reasonable must be used instead. Both parties must accept this substitute method.

2) If the agreed payment method becomes impossible or impractical due to governmental regulations, the seller may stop or withhold delivery until the buyer can provide an alternative payment method that is substantially equivalent. If the goods have been delivered already, the buyer would be discharged of their obligation to pay if they used the payment method provided by the regulation, unless that regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.

In simpler terms, this law is like saying if there's a roadblock on the way to your destination, you can't just give up. You have to try to find a detour that gets you there. Similarly, if your usual coffee shop suddenly refuses credit cards due to new government rules, you can't just take your coffee and leave, you need to find another way to pay that's equivalent, unless the rules are unfair.

## § 2-615. Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions.









Except so far as a sellermay have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance:

(a) Delay in delivery or non-delivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faithwith any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.
(b) Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contractas well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.
(c) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or non-delivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.

### commentary on ## § 2-615. Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions.


This section outlines circumstances in which a seller may be excused from fulfilling their obligations under a contract. 

(a) If an unforeseen event occurs, known as a contingency, that makes it impossible for the seller to carry out the contract as agreed, or if the seller is required to comply with a governmental regulation or order, they are not in breach of contract if they do not deliver, or delay delivery. 
(b) If such causes only partially affect the seller's ability to perform, they must fairly allocate their resources among their customers, including regular ones who may not be under contract at the time, as well as their own manufacturing needs. 
(c) The seller is obligated to inform the buyer of any potential delays or non-deliveries and the estimated allocated quota if allocation is required.

In simple terms, this is like if a baker contracted to make you a wedding cake but all the eggs in the country suddenly vanished. The baker isn't at fault for not making your cake. But if the baker also makes cookies, and they have some eggs left, they can't use all the eggs for the cookies, they need to fairly distribute them between cookies and cakes. And they have to tell you that your cake might be late or not come at all and how many eggs they have left for your cake.

Following this section, the procedure on notice claiming excuse is outlined in section § 2-616.


---

## § 2-616. Procedure on Notice Claiming Excuse.









(1) Where the buyer receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under the preceding section he may by written notification to the seller as to any delivery concerned, and where the prospective deficiency substantially impairs the value of the whole contract under the provisions of this Article relating to breach of installment contracts (Section 2-612), then also as to the whole,

(a) terminate and thereby discharge any unexecuted portion of the contract; or
(b) modify the contract by agreeing to take his available quota in substitution.

(2) If after receipt of such notification from the seller the buyer fails so to modify the contractwithin a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days the contract lapses with respect to any deliveries affected.
(3) The provisions of this section may not be negated by agreement except in so far as the sellerhas assumed a greater obligation under the preceding section.s

### commentary on ## § 2-616. Procedure on Notice Claiming Excuse.


This section outlines the process a buyer must follow upon receiving notification about a significant delay or allocation from the seller. 

In simple terms:

1) If a buyer is informed by the seller of a significant delay or a distribution plan that is justified, the buyer can respond in writing. If the delay is significant enough to greatly reduce the value of the contract, the buyer can either:
    a) Terminate any part of the contract that has not yet been executed, or
    b) Modify the contract by agreeing to accept the available quota as a substitute.

2) If the buyer does not modify the contract within a reasonable time, not exceeding thirty days, after receiving the seller's notification, the contract ends for any impacted deliveries.

3) The conditions of this section cannot be changed through agreement, unless the seller has agreed to a greater responsibility under the previous section. 

This section is preceded by § 2-615, which discusses excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, and is followed by Part 7, which tackles remedies to contract breaches.

### commentary on ## § 2-701. Remedies for Breach of Collateral contracts Not Impaired.


This section states that the provisions of this Article do not limit the remedies available for the breach of any additional obligations or promises that are related to, but not directly part of, a sales contract. 

For example, suppose a sales contract includes a side-agreement that the seller will also provide training on how to use the product sold. If the seller fails to provide this training, this section ensures that the buyer still has legal recourse, despite this promise not being the main objective of the contract.

This provision ensures that all promises and obligations tied to a contract, even if they are not the primary focus, are still legally enforceable.

In terms of timeline events, the relevance of this provision would become apparent when a breach of such collateral obligations occurs. Its counterparts in common law would be the principles providing remedies for the breach of ancillary or collateral terms of a contract.

## § 2-702. Seller's Remedies on Discovery of Buyer's Insolvency.









(1) Where the seller discovers the buyer to be insolvent he may refuse delivery except for cash including payment for all goods theretofore delivered under the contract, and stop delivery under this Article (Section 2-705).
(2) Where the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit while insolvent he may reclaim the goods upon demand made within ten days after the receipt, but if misrepresentation of solvency has been made to the particular seller in writing within three months before delivery the ten day limitation does not apply. Except as provided in this subsection the seller may not base a right to reclaim goods on the buyer's fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of solvency or of intent to pay.
(3) The seller's right to reclaim under subsection (2) is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser under this Article (Section 2-403). Successful reclamation of goodsexcludes all other remedies with respect to them.

### commentary on ## § 2-702. Seller's Remedies on Discovery of Buyer's Insolvency.


This section outlines the remedies available to a seller if they discover that the buyer is insolvent. 

In the first instance, the seller may refuse to deliver goods unless the buyer can pay in cash, including payment for all goods previously delivered under the contract. The seller can also stop the delivery of goods as per Section 2-705. 

If the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit while being insolvent, the seller has the right to reclaim those goods if a demand is made within ten days after the goods were received. However, if the buyer has misrepresented their solvency in writing to the seller within three months prior to the delivery, the ten-day limitation doesn’t apply. The seller cannot, however, base their right to reclaim the goods on the buyer's fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of solvency or intent to pay, except as provided in this subsection.

The right of the seller to reclaim goods is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary course (a buyer who purchases goods in good faith without knowledge of any violation of ownership rights) or other good faith purchaser under Section 2-403. If the seller is successful in reclaiming the goods, they cannot seek any other remedies with respect to these goods. 

This section was amended in 1966.

## § 2-703. Seller's Remedies in General.









Where the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment due on or before delivery or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then with respect to any goods directly affected and, if the breach is of the whole contract (Section 2-612), then also with respect to the whole undelivered balance, the aggrieved sellermay

(a) withhold delivery of such goods;
(b) stop delivery by any bailee as hereafter provided (Section 2-705);
(c) proceed under the next section respecting goods still unidentified to the contract;
(d) resell and recover damages as hereafter provided (Section 2-706);
(e) recover damages for non-acceptance (Section 2-708) or in a proper case the price (Section 2-709);
(f) cancel.

### commentary on ## § 2-703. Seller's Remedies in General.


This section outlines the remedies available to a seller in case the buyer breaches the contract, either by unjustly rejecting the goods, revoking their acceptance, failing to pay on time, or fully or partially repudiating the contract. The remedies include withholding or stopping delivery, identifying unallocated goods to the contract, reselling the goods, recovering damages or the price, or cancelling the contract. 

An equivalent situation could be if someone refused to pay for a meal they ordered at a restaurant (breach of contract). The restaurant can then refuse to serve the meal (withhold delivery), stop the meal from being served if it's already on its way to the table (stop delivery), assign the meal to another customer (identify goods to the contract), sell the meal to someone else (resell), ask the customer to pay for the meal or compensate for any losses (recover damages or the price), or cancel the order altogether (cancel the contract). 

This section is essentially a blueprint for what a seller can do when a buyer doesn't hold up their end of the deal. It provides a range of options, from simply not delivering the goods to seeking compensation for any losses, offering flexibility depending on the specific circumstances of the breach.

## § 2-704. Seller's Right to Identify Goods to the Contract Notwithstanding Breach or to Salvage Unfinished Goods.









(1) An aggrieved sellerunder the preceding section may

(a) identify to the contract conforming goodsnot already identified if at the time he learned of the breach they are in his possession or control;
(b) treat as the subject of resale goods which have demonstrably been intended for the particular contract even though those goods are unfinished.

(2) Where the goods are unfinished an aggrieved seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization either complete the manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the contractor cease manufacture and resell for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner.

### commentary on ## § 2-704. Seller's Right to Identify Goods to the Contract Notwithstanding Breach or to Salvage Unfinished Goods.


This law gives a seller, who has been wronged by a buyer, the power to assign goods to a breached contract if he/she still has possession of the items when he/she learns of the breach. The seller can also regard unfinished goods, intended for the breached contract, as goods to be resold. If the goods are not finished, the seller, using reasonable commercial judgment, can choose to complete production and assign the goods to the contract, sell the unfinished goods as scrap or salvage, or select another reasonable approach. 

Imagine running a custom furniture business and a customer cancels a large order midway through production. This law allows you, the seller, to designate the half-finished furniture as items to be sold to another buyer. If the furniture is unfinished, you can choose to complete the pieces and sell them to another customer, sell the half-finished pieces as is, or take another reasonable action. 

This law is situated between § 2-703, which details a seller's general remedies in case of a breach, and § 2-705, which discusses a seller's right to stop delivery of goods in transit or otherwise in case of a breach.


---

## § 2-705. Seller's Stoppage of Delivery in Transit or Otherwise.









(1) The seller may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee when he discovers the buyer to be insolvent (Section 2-702) and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload or larger shipments of express or freight when the buyer repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery or if for any other reason the seller has a right to withhold or reclaim the goods.
(2) As against such buyer the sellermay stop delivery until

(a) receipt of the goods by the buyer; or
(b) acknowledgment to the buyer by any bailee of the goodsexcept a carrier that the bailee holds the goods for the buyer; or
(c) such acknowledgment to the buyerby a carrier by reshipment or as warehouseman; or
(d) negotiation to the buyer of any negotiable document of title covering the goods.

(3)(a) To stop delivery the seller must so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the goods.

(b) After such notification the bailee must hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the sellerbut the seller is liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damages.
(c) If a negotiable document of title has been issued for goodsthe bailee is not obliged to obey a notification to stop until surrender of the document.
(d) A carrier who has issued a non-negotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor.

### commentary on ## § 2-705. Seller's Stoppage of Delivery in Transit or Otherwise.


This section outlines the seller's right to stop the delivery of goods in transit or otherwise. This right is triggered when the buyer is insolvent, repudiates, or fails to make a payment due before delivery. The seller may also stop delivery for any other reason that gives them a right to withhold or reclaim the goods.

The seller can cease delivery until the goods are received by the buyer, acknowledged by a bailee (excluding a carrier) that they are holding the goods for the buyer, acknowledged by a carrier via reshipment or as a warehouseman, or the title of goods has been negotiated to the buyer. 

For the seller to stop delivery, they must notify the bailee in a way that allows the bailee to prevent delivery of the goods. After such notification, the bailee must follow the seller's instructions, but the seller is liable for any ensuing charges or damages. 

If a negotiable document of title has been issued for the goods, the bailee is not obliged to obey a notification to stop until the document is surrendered. Also, a carrier who has issued a non-negotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor. 

Analogously, this can be compared to a seller having the right to cancel a shipment with a courier service if the buyer is unable to pay or for other valid reasons. The courier service, in this case, acts as the bailee, and must follow the seller's instructions upon receiving a notification to stop delivery. However, the seller would be responsible for any extra charges or damages resulting from this action.

## § 2-706. Seller's Resale Including Contract for Resale.









(1) Under the conditions stated in Section 2-703 on seller's remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this Article (Section 2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer'sbreach.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goodsbe in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.
(3) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyerreasonable notification of his intention to resell.
(4) Where the resale is at public sale

(a) only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goodsof the kind; and
(b) it must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily the seller must give the buyerreasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and
(c) if the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where the goodsare located and provide for their reasonable inspection by prospective bidders; and
(d) the seller may buy.

(5) A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the sellerfails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this section.
(6) The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (Section 2-707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of Section 2-711).

### commentary on ## § 2-706. Seller's Resale Including Contract for Resale.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code allows a seller to resell goods or the undelivered balance of goods, under certain conditions, if the original buyer has breached the contract. The seller can recoup damages, including the difference between the resale price and the original contract price, if the resale is done in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.

The resale can be done either publicly or privately, and can include one or multiple subsequent sales. However, the seller must provide reasonable notice to the original buyer if the resale is a private sale. If the resale is public, the seller must also give notice of the time and place of the sale, unless the goods are perishable or likely to rapidly depreciate in value.

Under this section, a buyer who purchases the goods in good faith at a resale is not bound by any rights of the original buyer, even if the seller did not comply with all the requirements of this section. Finally, the seller is not required to share any profit made from the resale with the original buyer, but may have to account for any excess if the buyer had rightfully rejected or revoked acceptance of the goods.

## § 2-707. "Person in the Position of a Seller".









(1) A "person in the position of a seller" includes as against a principal an agent who has paid or become responsible for the price of goods on behalf of his principal or anyone who otherwise holds a security interest or other right in goods similar to that of a seller.
(2) A person in the position of a seller may as provided in this Article withhold or stop delivery (Section 2-705) and resell (Section 2-706) and recover incidental damages (Section 2-710).

### commentary on ## § 2-707. "Person in the Position of a Seller".


This section refers to anyone acting in the capacity of a seller, even if they are not the original owner of the goods. This can include agents who have already paid or taken responsibility for the price of goods on behalf of their principals, or anyone with a similar security interest or right in the goods. Just like a seller, this person can withhold or stop delivery of the goods, resell them, and recover any incidental damages, as per the provisions of this Article. This can include situations where a buyer refuses to accept the goods or cancels the contract. 

For example, if a purchasing agent buys a consignment of goods on behalf of their employer, then they would be considered a "person in the position of a seller". If the employer then refuses to accept the goods or pay for them, the purchasing agent can stop the delivery, resell the goods, and recover any incidental damages they may have incurred.


---

## § 2-708. Seller's Damages for Non-acceptance or Repudiation.









(1) Subject to subsection (2) and to the provisions of this Article with respect to proof of market price (Section 2-723), the measure of damages for non-acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (Section 2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.
(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this Article (Section 2-710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.

### commentary on ## § 2-708. Seller's Damages for Non-acceptance or Repudiation.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) addresses the potential damages a seller may claim if a buyer either refuses to accept goods or repudiates their contract. 

Subsection (1) states that the basic measure of damages is the difference between the market price at the time and place of the contract and the unpaid price of the contract, along with any incidental damages. However, any expenses saved due to the buyer's breach should be subtracted from this figure.

Subsection (2) provides an alternative measure of damages if the first one does not adequately compensate the seller. In this case, the damages can be calculated as the profit, including reasonable overhead, that the seller would have made if the buyer fully performed the contract, along with any incidental damages. The seller must also give due allowance for costs reasonably incurred, and credit for payments or proceeds from reselling the goods.

In simpler terms, if a buyer bails on a contract, the seller can generally claim the difference between the agreed price and the current market price, plus any incidental damages. If that's not enough to cover the seller's loss, the seller can claim what they would have made in profit if the deal had gone through. But the seller also needs to factor in any costs they managed to avoid because of the buyer's breach, and any money they made from reselling the goods.

## § 2-709. Action for the Price.









(1) When the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due the sellermay recover, together with any incidental damages under the next section, the price

(a) of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and
(b) of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.

(2) Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods which have been identified to the contractand are still in his control except that if resale becomes possible he may resell them at any time prior to the collection of the judgment. The net proceeds of any such resale must be credited to the buyer and payment of the judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.
(3) After the buyer has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of the goods or has failed to make a payment due or has repudiated (Section 2-610), a sellerwho is held not entitled to the price under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under the preceding section.

### commentary on ## § 2-709. Action for the Price.


This section outlines the consequences when a buyer fails to pay the agreed price for goods. 

In subsection (1), when the buyer fails to pay the due price, the seller has the right to recover the price along with any incidental damages. This includes the price of goods that have been accepted by the buyer, or of goods that have been lost or damaged after the risk of their loss had been passed onto the buyer. The seller may also recover the price of goods that have been identified in the contract, if the seller is unable to resell them at a reasonable price or if circumstances indicate that reselling will be unsuccessful.

Subsection (2) states that if the seller sues for the price, they must hold any goods identified in the contract that are still in their control for the buyer. However, the seller can resell the goods if the opportunity arises, before the judgment for the lawsuit is collected. The net proceeds from the resale should be credited to the buyer, and payment of the judgment allows the buyer to claim any goods not resold.

Lastly, subsection (3) states that even if the seller is not entitled to the price due to the buyer's wrongful rejection or revocation of acceptance of the goods, failure to make due payment, or repudiation, the seller is still entitled to damages for non-acceptance under the preceding section.

## § 2-710. Seller's Incidental Damages.









Incidental damages to an aggrieved seller include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the buyer'sbreach, in connection with return or resale of the goods or otherwise resulting from the breach.

### commentary on ## § 2-710. Seller's Incidental Damages.


This section indicates that a seller who has been wronged has the right to recover any reasonable costs associated with stopping delivery, taking care of the goods, shipping them back, or reselling them, or any other costs that result from the buyer's breach of contract. 

For example, if a buyer backs out of a purchase after the goods have already been sent, the seller could recoup the cost of stopping the delivery and returning the goods to their place of origin. Additionally, any expenses related to storing the goods while a new buyer is found would also be covered.

This is similar to the concept of consequential damages, which refers to any losses incurred due to the breach of a contract that were not the direct result of the violation. The main difference is that incidental damages are incurred in the normal course of business after a breach, while consequential damages are more indirectly related to the breach.

In a timeline of events, this would come into play after the buyer has breached the contract and the seller has incurred costs as a result. It's a fairly common provision in contract law, designed to protect the non-breaching party from suffering undue financial hardship as a result of the other party's failure to uphold their end of the agreement.

## § 2-711. Buyer's Remedies in General; Buyer's Security Interest in Rejected Goods.









(1) Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or the buyer rightfully rejects or justifiably revokes acceptance then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract (Section 2-612), the buyer may cancel and whether or not he has done so may in addition to recovering so much of the price as has been paid

(a) "cover" and have damages under the next section as to all the goods affected whether or not they have been identified to the contract; or
(b) recover damages for non-delivery as provided in this Article (Section 2-713).

(2) Where the seller fails to deliver or repudiates the buyermay also

(a) if the goods have been identified recover them as provided in this Article (Section 2-502); or
(b) in a proper case obtain specific performance or replevy the goods as provided in this Article (Section 2-716).

(3) On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a security interest in goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, care and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved seller (Section 2-706).

### commentary on ## § 2-711. Buyer's Remedies in General; Buyer's Security Interest in Rejected Goods.


This section outlines the remedies for a buyer in case the seller fails to deliver goods, revokes acceptance, or the buyer rightfully rejects the goods. 

In such cases, the buyer may cancel the contract and can recover any amount of the price already paid. They can either 'cover' - that is, procure substitute goods and claim damages for any price difference - or they can recover damages for non-delivery. 

If the goods have been identified, the buyer can recover them, or in some cases can obtain specific performance (i.e., require the seller to perform their contractual obligations) or replevy the goods (i.e., recover goods wrongfully taken or retained). 

If the buyer has rightfully rejected the goods or justifiably revoked acceptance, they have a security interest in the goods they possess or control for any payments made toward them and for any expenses incurred in relation to the goods. The buyer can hold and resell these goods in the same manner as a wronged seller.

This section essentially provides protection for buyers against sellers who fail to fulfill their contractual obligations. It allows the buyer to either 'cover' by purchasing substitute goods or recover damages for non-delivery, and in some cases recover the goods or require specific performance from the seller. If the buyer has paid for the goods or incurred expenses related to them, they have a security interest in the goods.


---

## § 2-712. "Cover"; Buyer's Procurement of Substitute Goods.









(1) After a breach within the preceding section the buyer may "cover" by making in good faith and without unreasonable delay any reasonable purchase of or contract to purchase goods in substitution for those due from the seller.
(2) The buyer may recover from the seller as damages the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price together with any incidental or consequential damages as hereinafter defined (Section 2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.
(3) Failure of the buyerto effect cover within this section does not bar him from any other remedy.

### commentary on ## § 2-712. "Cover"; Buyer's Procurement of Substitute Goods.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines the concept of "cover", which refers to a buyer's right to procure substitute goods in the event of a breach of contract by the seller. 

In simpler terms, if a seller fails to deliver goods as promised, the buyer can go out and buy similar goods from a different supplier. This should be done in good faith and without unreasonable delay.

The buyer can then sue the seller for the difference between the cost of these substitute goods and the original contract price. The buyer can also claim any incidental or consequential damages that occurred as a result of the breach. However, any expenses that the buyer saved due to the seller's breach must be deducted from the damages.

If the buyer doesn't "cover" by buying substitute goods, they are still entitled to other legal remedies. 

In other words, if you order a pizza and the pizzeria doesn't deliver, you can go buy a pizza from somewhere else and then sue the original pizzeria for the extra cost plus any other damages (like if you got so hungry waiting for the pizza that you fainted and hit your head). But, if you didn't manage to get another pizza, you can still take the pizzeria to court for not delivering your meal. 

Please note that this is only a general summary and not legal advice. Always consult with a legal professional for advice related to your specific situation.

## § 2-713. Buyer's Damages for Non-delivery or Repudiation.









(1) Subject to the provisions of this Article with respect to proof of market price (Section 2-723), the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this Article (Section 2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.
(2)Market price is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.

§ 2-714. Buyer's Damages for Breach in Regard to Accepted Goods. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-713. Buyer's Damages for Non-delivery or Repudiation.


In simple terms, section 2-713 discusses the damages a buyer can claim if a seller fails to deliver goods or backs out of the contract. The damages are calculated as the difference between the market price of the goods when the buyer realizes the breach and the initial contract price. This could also include any additional incidental and consequential damages, but would deduct any expenses that the buyer managed to save due to the seller's breach.

To give an analogy, if you ordered a designer dress for a special event and the seller fails to deliver it, you can seek damages. The damages would be the difference between the price you originally agreed to pay and the current market price of the dress when you find out that the seller won't be delivering it. If you had to pay more for a last-minute replacement or incurred additional costs, those could also be included in the damages. However, if you managed to save on some costs because the dress wasn't delivered - maybe you didn't need to pay for alterations - that amount would be subtracted from the total damages.

Think of this provision as a safety net for buyers. If a seller doesn't deliver on their promises, the buyer has a legal way to recover some or all of their losses. This can be particularly important in business contexts, where a breach of contract could have significant financial implications.

## § 2-714. Buyer's Damages for Breach in Regard to Accepted Goods.









(1) Where the buyer has accepted goods and given notification (subsection (3) of Section 2-607) he may recover as damages for any non-conformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller'sbreach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.
(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goodsaccepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.
(3)In a proper case any incidental and consequential damages under the next section may also be recovered.

### commentary on ## § 2-714. Buyer's Damages for Breach in Regard to Accepted Goods.


This section of the law outlines the scenarios and methods for calculating damages in case a buyer accepts goods that do not meet the agreed upon standards or specifications. 

1) The first part states that if a buyer has accepted goods and has provided the necessary notification of any non-conformity, they can recover damages resulting from the seller's breach. The determination of these damages is subject to be made in any reasonable manner.

2) The second part provides a specific measure for damages in case of a breach of warranty. The damages are calculated based on the difference in value of the goods at the time and place of acceptance and their value if they had been as warranted. However, in special circumstances, damages might be calculated based on a different amount if it can be shown to be directly resulting from the breach.

3) The third part allows for the recovery of any incidental and consequential damages in appropriate cases, as outlined in the next section of the law.

This section essentially provides a safety net for buyers in case they end up accepting goods that do not meet the agreed upon standards or conditions.

## § 2-715. Buyer's Incidental and Consequential Damages.









(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller's breach include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goodsrightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.
(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller'sbreach include

(a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the sellerat the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and
(b) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.

§ 2-716. Buyer's Right to Specific Performance or Replevin. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-715. Buyer's Incidental and Consequential Damages.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) deals with the buyer's right to claim incidental and consequential damages in case of a breach of contract by the seller.

Incidental damages can include any reasonable costs that the buyer incurs because of the seller's breach. This can include costs related to inspecting, receiving, transporting, and caring for the goods which were rightfully rejected. It can also include any reasonable charges or expenses connected with finding a replacement for the goods (also known as 'covering') and any other reasonable expenses caused by the delay or breach.

Consequential damages can include any losses that are a direct result of the seller's breach and which the seller should have reasonably foreseen at the time of the contract. These can include losses that the buyer incurs because of specific requirements or needs that the seller knew about when they entered into the contract. It can also include damages for any personal injury or damage to property that results from a breach of warranty.

This law is essentially saying that if a seller doesn't uphold their end of a contract, they could be responsible for more than just the cost of the goods - they could also be on the hook for these additional incidental and consequential damages. 

This section comes after UCC § 2-714, which discusses buyer's damages for breach in regard to accepted goods, and before § 2-716, which discusses a buyer's right to specific performance or replevin (recovering goods in the event of a breach).

## § 2-716. Buyer's Right to Specific Performance or Replevin.


Primary tabs







(1) Specific performance may be decreed where the goodsare unique or in other proper circumstances.
(2)The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just.
(3) The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contractif after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered.

### commentary on ## § 2-716. Buyer's Right to Specific Performance or Replevin.


The provision under review, 2-716 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), outlines the buyer's right to either specific performance or replevin. This means that a buyer can ask the court to force the seller to fulfill the contract or return the goods that were involved in the contract.

Subsection (1) stipulates that specific performance, where the seller is made to deliver the exact goods stated in the contract, can be mandated if the goods are unique or in other circumstances deemed suitable. 

Subsection (2) elaborates that along with specific performance, the court can also include stipulations about payment of the price, any damages, and other relief it deems fair.

Subsection (3) establishes the right of the buyer to replevin. In other words, the buyer can retake possession of goods that were part of the contract under certain conditions. These include if the buyer has tried and failed to find a suitable replacement (cover) for the goods, if the circumstances suggest that finding a replacement wouldn't be possible, or if the goods have been sent but the seller's security interest in them has been satisfied or tendered. 

These legal rights protect buyers in commercial transactions, ensuring that they can either get what they bargained for or get their goods back if the seller does not fulfill their part of the contract.

## § 2-717. Deduction of Damages From the Price.









The buyer on notifying the seller of his intention to do so may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any breach of the contractfrom any part of the price still due under the same contract.

§ 2-718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-717. Deduction of Damages From the Price.


This section states that if a buyer identifies that the seller has breached the contract, the buyer can notify the seller of their intention to deduct some or all of the damages that resulted from that breach from the remaining amount owed on the contract. 

For example, if a buyer purchases a car for $10,000 and pays a $2,000 deposit, but later discovers that the car has a defect that will cost $1,000 to fix, the buyer can notify the seller of their intention to deduct the $1,000 repair cost from the $8,000 remaining to be paid, thus making the balance due $7,000.

In a timeline of events, this would take place after the discovery of the breach but before the final payment is made.

A commonly referred counterpart is the seller's equivalent right to claim damages or demand performance under other sections of the contract law, ensuring fair treatment for both parties to the contract.


---

## § 2-718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits.









(1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreementbut only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.
(2) Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyer'sbreach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds

(a) the amount to which the selleris entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the seller's damages in accordance with subsection (1), or
(b) in the absence of such terms, twenty per cent of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or $500, whichever is smaller.

(3) The buyer's right to restitution under subsection (2) is subject to offset to the extent that the sellerestablishes

(a) a right to recover damages under the provisions of this Article other than subsection (1), and
(b) the amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indirectly by reason of the contract.

(4) Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (2); but if the seller has notice of the buyer's breach before reselling goods received in part performance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this Article on resale by an aggrieved seller (Section 2-706).

up
§ 2-719. Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy. ›







### commentary on ## § 2-718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits.


This section discusses liquidated damages, which are predetermined damages agreed upon by parties in a contract if a breach occurs. 

Specifically:

1) Any provision for liquidated damages must be reasonable, considering the potential or actual damage caused by the breach, the difficulty in proving the loss, and the challenge in finding another suitable remedy. Unreasonably high liquidated damages are considered a penalty and thus invalid.

2) If the seller rightfully withholds delivery of goods due to the buyer's breach, the buyer can reclaim any payments that exceed calculated liquidated damages or, if there's no such term, 20% of the contract value or $500 (whichever is smaller).

3) The buyer's right to a refund is subject to adjustments based on any damages the seller can claim from this section, except for subsection (1), and any benefits the buyer received due to the contract.

4) If the seller received payment in goods, the reasonable value or resale proceeds of these goods count as payment for the purpose of subsection (2). However, if the seller knew about the buyer's breach before reselling the goods, the conditions of resale by an aggrieved seller (Section 2-706) apply.

Think of this like a safety net for both parties. It offers protection to the seller if the buyer breaches the contract, and to the buyer by ensuring they can recover excess payments. But it also prevents sellers from setting exorbitantly high penalties for contract breaches.


---

## § 2-719. Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy.









(1)Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages,

(a) the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goodsand repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts; and
(b) resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.

(2)Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Act.
(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goodsis prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.

### commentary on ## § 2-719. Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy.


This section allows for the modification or alteration of remedies and damages in a contractual agreement. However, any such alterations are subject to certain limitations and conditions. 

Subsection (1) provides that, in addition to or instead of the remedies provided by this Article, the contractual agreement can offer other remedies or can limit or change the damages recoverable. For example, the contract can limit the buyer's remedies to returning the goods and getting a refund, or to repairing or replacing non-conforming goods or parts. However, a remedy is optional unless the contract specifically states that it is the only remedy available.

Subsection (2) stipulates that if an exclusive or limited remedy fails to serve its basic purpose, then other remedies may be sought as provided in this Act.

Subsection (3) allows for the limitation or exclusion of consequential damages unless such limitation or exclusion is deemed unconscionable. If the limitation of consequential damages is related to personal injury in the case of consumer goods, it is generally considered unconscionable. However, limiting damages where the loss is commercial is not considered unconscionable.

In simpler terms, this section allows for flexibility in determining remedies and damages in a contract, but also provides protections to prevent unfair or inequitable outcomes.

### commentary on ## § 2-720. Effect of "Cancellation" or "Rescission" on Claims for Antecedent Breach.


This section clarifies that unless explicitly stated otherwise, stating that a contract is "cancelled" or "rescinded" should not be interpreted as waiving or dismissing any claims for damages that resulted from a breach that happened before the cancellation or rescission. 

For instance, if a supplier breaches a contract by delivering damaged goods and the buyer decides to cancel the contract, this doesn't mean the buyer is giving up their right to seek damages for the supplier's prior breach. The buyer can still pursue a claim for damages resulting from that breach.

In short, cancelling or rescinding a contract doesn't automatically mean you're also giving up any claims for damages you may have due to breaches that occurred before the cancellation or rescission. Unless it's explicitly stated, those claims for damages are still valid.

### commentary on ## § 2-721. Remedies for Fraud.


This section discusses the remedies available in cases where there is a material misrepresentation or fraud. These remedies include all those that are available for non-fraudulent breach under this article. This means that even if the victim of fraud chooses to cancel or rescind the contract, or reject or return the goods, they can still claim damages or another form of remedy. The decision to rescind the contract or return the goods does not preclude or contradict the claim for damages or other remedies. 

In simpler terms, victims of fraud or misrepresentation in a contract for the sale of goods have several options. They can cancel the contract or return the goods, and they can also sue for damages or seek other solutions. The law doesn't force them to choose between these options - they can pursue all of them if they wish.

(a) a right of action against the third party is in either party to the contract for sale who has title to or a security interest or a special property or an insurable interest in the goods; and if the goods have been destroyed or converted a right of action is also in the party who either bore the risk of loss under the contract for saleor has since the injury assumed that risk as against the other;
(b) if at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the contract for sale and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement is, subject to his own interest, as a fiduciary for the other party to the contract;
(c) either party may with the consent of the other sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.

(a) If a third party damages goods that are part of a contract for sale, the party that has the title, security interest, special property, or insurable interest in the goods has the right to sue the third party. If the goods have been destroyed or converted, the party who bore the risk of loss under the contract for sale, or who has assumed that risk since the injury, also has the right to sue.

(b) If the party suing did not bear the risk of loss at the time of the injury and there is no agreement between them about how any recovered damages would be distributed, they act as a trustee for the other party in the contract during the lawsuit or settlement. 

(c) With mutual consent, either party can sue for the benefit of relevant parties. 

Think of it like a car you've sold but not yet delivered. If a third party damages it before it reaches the buyer, you - as the seller who still technically owns the car - can sue. If the car was totally wrecked and the cost falls on you per the sales contract, or if you've agreed to assume that risk, you can also sue. But if you're not the one bearing the cost of the loss and there's no agreement on who gets any money recovered, you're basically suing on behalf of the other party. Of course, both parties can agree for one to sue on behalf of everyone concerned.

## § 2-723. Proof of Market Price: Time and Place.









(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (Section 2-708 or Section 2-713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.
(2) If evidence of a price prevailing at the times or places described in this Article is not readily available the price prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the cost of transporting the goodsto or from such other place.
(3)Evidence of a relevant price prevailing at a time or place other than the one described in this Article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party such notice as the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.

### commentary on ## § 2-723. Proof of Market Price: Time and Place.


This section provides guidelines for determining damages in cases of anticipatory repudiation, where a contract is breached before the time for performance. 

Subsection 1 states that if a trial for anticipatory repudiation occurs before the deadline of performance for some or all of the products, the damages will be calculated based on the market price at the time the aggrieved party found out about the repudiation. 

Subsection 2 offers a solution if there is no readily available data on the market price at the time or place stated in the contract. A price from a reasonable time frame before or after the event, or from a different location that would serve as a reasonable substitute, can be used. Any applicable transportation costs for the goods must be taken into account. 

Subsection 3 sets out that if one party wants to present evidence of a price from a different time or location than the one stated in the contract, they must give sufficient notice to the other party to prevent any unjust surprises. 

Imagine if you bought a concert ticket, but the band announced they wouldn't be performing. The damages would be based on the ticket price when you heard about the cancellation. If there's no data on that price, they might look at the price a week earlier or later, or at a different venue, minus any transportation costs. But if the band wanted to use a price from a completely different time or location, they'd have to warn you first to avoid catching you off guard.

## § 2-724. Admissibility of Market Quotations.









Whenever the prevailing price or value of any goodsregularly bought and sold in any established commodity market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such market shall be admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of such a report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.

### commentary on ## § 2-724. Admissibility of Market Quotations.


This section essentially allows market reports from official publications, trade journals, or widely circulated newspapers to be used as evidence in court when the price or value of a commodity is in dispute. However, while the conditions under which the report was prepared can impact the court's consideration of the report's value, it cannot impact its admissibility.

Imagine this as accepting a commonly respected weather forecast as evidence for a picnic being rained out, but the fact that the forecast was prepared by a notoriously error-prone meteorologist might influence how seriously the forecast is taken.

## § 2-725. Statute of Limitations in Contracts for Sale.









(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreementthe parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.
(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goodsand discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.
(3) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the terminationof the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.
(4) This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action which have accrued before this Act becomes effective.

### commentary on ## § 2-725. Statute of Limitations in Contracts for Sale.


This section outlines the terms for the statute of limitations in contracts for sale. 

(1) Legal action for breach of contract must start within four years from when the transgression occurred. The original contract parties can reduce the time limit to a minimum of one year, but they cannot extend it beyond four years.

(2) The breach is considered to have occurred at the time of the actual violation, whether or not the party suffering harm knew of the breach. If the contract includes a warranty, the breach is considered to have occurred at the time of delivery, unless the warranty specifically covers future performance. In the latter case, the breach is considered to have occurred when the issue should have been or was discovered.

(3) If legal action begins within the four-year limit and ends without resolution, another action for the same breach can start, so long as it is within six months of the first action ending. This is not applicable if the first action was intentionally discontinued or dismissed due to negligence.

(4) This section does not change the law on the suspension of the statute of limitations and does not apply to breaches that occurred before this Act came into effect.

In simpler terms, if you have a problem with a product you purchased, you generally have up to four years to file a lawsuit about it, unless the contract states a shorter period. The clock starts ticking when the problem arises, not when you discover it, unless the product comes with a warranty for future performance. If your first lawsuit fails, you might have a six-month grace period to try again, depending on the circumstances. This rule doesn't change any existing rules about when the clock can be paused or apply to problems that arose before the rule was implemented.

### commentary on ## PART 4. TITLE, CREDITORS AND GOOD FAITH PURCHASERS


§ 2-401. Passing of Title; Reservation for Security; Limited Application of This Section.

This section governs the transition of ownership from the seller to the buyer. It establishes when and how the title (ownership) of the goods is passed from one party to another. Additionally, this section also discusses the conditions under which a seller can reserve the title for security purposes - this essentially means that the seller can retain legal ownership of the goods until certain conditions, often the full payment of the purchase price, are met by the buyer. However, the applicability of this section is limited and does not extend to all sales transactions, typically depending on the specificities of the contract.

§ 2-402. Rights of Seller's Creditors Against Sold Goods.

This provision covers the rights of creditors of the seller against goods that have been sold. If a seller owes money to creditors, those creditors might have a claim to the proceeds of the sale of goods or even the goods themselves, depending on the specifics of the debt. This section provides the legal framework for such situations.

§ 2-403. Power to Transfer; Good Faith Purchase of Goods; "Entrusting".

This section deals with the legitimacy of a transfer of goods, the concept of "good faith" purchasing, and the legal principle of "entrusting". It explores who has the power to transfer ownership of goods and under what circumstances, as well as the rights of a person who purchases the goods in good faith (meaning without knowledge of any potential problems with the sale). “Entrusting” refers to the idea that if an owner gives possession of their goods to another party (usually a merchant), that party might be able to legally sell those goods, even without explicit permission from the owner.

### commentary on ## PART 7. REMEDIES


§ 2-701. Remedies for Breach of Collateral contracts Not Impaired: This section safeguards the rights and remedies of a party when a breach of collateral contracts (related but separate agreements) occurs. The breach of one contract does not affect the remedies available for the breach of another.

§ 2-702. Seller's Remedies on Discovery of Buyer's Insolvency: If the seller discovers that the buyer is insolvent, the seller has certain remedies, including the right to stop the delivery of goods, reclaim the goods, or demand cash payment before the delivery.

§ 2-703. Seller's Remedies in General: This section lists various remedies available to the seller when the buyer fails to perform their obligations. It includes remedies like withholding delivery, identifying goods to the contract, stopping delivery, reselling, recovering damages, or forcing buyer to pay.

§ 2-704. Seller's Right to Identify Goods to the Contract Notwithstanding Breach or to Salvage Unfinished Goods: This provision allows the seller to identify goods to the contract even after a breach has occurred, or to save unfinished goods.

§ 2-705. Seller's Stoppage of Delivery in Transit or Otherwise: This grants the seller the right to stop the delivery of goods in transit if the buyer is insolvent or if the buyer repudiates the contract.

§ 2-706. Seller's Resale Including Contract for Resale: If the buyer breaches the contract, the seller can resell the goods and recover damages.

§ 2-707. "Person in the Position of a Seller": This section clarifies who can be considered a seller, especially in situations where the original seller is not involved.

§ 2-708. Seller's Damages for Non-acceptance or Repudiation: This outlines the damages that a seller can recover if the buyer refuses to accept goods or repudiates the contract.

§ 2-709. Action for the Price: This section allows the seller to sue for the price of the goods under certain conditions.

§ 2-710. Seller's Incidental Damages: This outlines additional damages that the seller can recover, such as expenses incurred in handling, storing, or reselling the goods.

The rest of the sections until § 2-725 cover the remedies available to the buyer, guidelines on modifying or limiting remedies, the effect of contract cancellation or rescission, remedies for fraud, regulatory provisions for third-party lawsuits for goods damage, rules for proving market price, admissibility of market quotations, and the statute of limitations.

This section is basically the formal introduction to the Leases section of the Uniform Commercial Code. It's like shouting, "Let the leasing law shenanigans begin!" at the start of a particularly formal but equally dry party. It doesn't tell us much about what's inside, but it's essentially the name tag for all the legal guidelines, rules, and procedures related to leasing that are about to follow.

### commentary on ## § 2A-103. DEFINITIONS AND INDEX OF DEFINITIONS.


This legal document presents definitions for various terms used in the context of a lease or rental agreement, as per a specific Article within an undisclosed jurisdiction. The definitions are precise, providing context for the words in relation to commercial and consumer leasing. Some of these terms include "Buyer in ordinary course of business," "Cancellation," "Commercial unit," "Consumer lease," "Fault," "Finance lease," "Goods," "Installment lease contract," "Lease," among others. 

The latter part of this section refers to other sections where further definitions can be found, and reminds readers that Article 1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation that apply throughout the Article in question. 

This document provides critical vocabulary for understanding leasing agreements and the obligations, rights, and responsibilities of both lessors and lessees. It is essential for anyone involved in the leasing industry or who is planning to enter into a lease agreement. 

It's worth noting that the specifics here could vary based on jurisdiction and the particularities of individual cases, therefore, it's always advisable to consult with a legal expert or attorney when trying to understand or apply these terms.

## § 2A-104. LEASES SUBJECT TO OTHER LAW.










(1) A lease, although subject to this Article, is also subject to any applicable:

(a) certificate of title statute of this State: (list any certificate of title statutes covering automobiles, trailers, mobile homes, boats, farm tractors, and the like);
(b) certificate of title statute of another jurisdiction (Section 2A-105); or
(c) consumer protection statute of this State, or final consumer protection decision of a court of this State existing on the effective date of this Article.


(2) In case of conflict between this Article, other than Sections 2A-105, 2A-304(3), and 2A-305(3), and a statute or decision referred to in subsection (1), the statute or decision controls.
(3) Failure to comply with an applicable law has only the effect specified therein.

### commentary on ## § 2A-104. LEASES SUBJECT TO OTHER LAW.


This law essentially states that although leases are subject to the regulations and rules within this Article, they are also subject to any other applicable laws, including title certificate laws of both the state and other jurisdictions, as well as consumer protection laws, or any final decisions made by a court regarding consumer protection. 

If there is a conflict between this Article and another law that is referenced in subsection (1), the other law takes precedence, unless the sections 2A-105, 2A-304(3), and 2A-305(3) of this Article are involved. 

Finally, failure to comply with other applicable laws will only have the effects specified within those laws.

(Skeptical and mildly jaded analogy: It's like saying, "Yes, our rules apply, but so do a bunch of others. If our rules clash with theirs, theirs win. Also, if you break their rules, you face their consequences.")

## § 2A-105. TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF ARTICLE TO GOODS COVERED BY CERTIFICATE OF TITLE.










Subject to the provisions of Sections 2A-304(3) and 2A-305(3), with respect to goods covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction, compliance and the effect of compliance or noncompliance with a certificate of title statute are governed by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) of the jurisdiction issuing the certificate until the earlier of (a) surrender of the certificate, or (b) four months after the goods are removed from that jurisdiction and thereafter until a new certificate of title is issued by another jurisdiction.

### commentary on ## § 2A-105. TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF ARTICLE TO GOODS COVERED BY CERTIFICATE OF TITLE.


This section essentially deals with the laws applicable to goods that have a certificate of title issued under the statute of a particular jurisdiction. The compliance or non-compliance with the certificate of title statute is governed by the law of the jurisdiction that issued the certificate. This rule remains in place until the certificate is surrendered or until four months after the goods have been removed from that jurisdiction, at which point, the laws of the new jurisdiction (that issues a new certificate of title) would apply. It's a bit like saying the rule of the land (where the goods were initially registered) applies until you officially register the goods elsewhere or after a specified time has passed since physically moving the goods out of that jurisdiction. 

For example, if you have a car with a title issued in California, California laws apply to that car. If you drive that car to Nevada and do not surrender the California title or get a new Nevada title within four months, Nevada laws will start to apply. 

This section is followed by sections that limit the ability of parties in a consumer lease to choose their own laws and judicial forum.


---

## § 2A-106. LIMITATION ON POWER OF PARTIES TO CONSUMER LEASE TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW AND JUDICIAL FORUM.










(1) If the law chosen by the parties to a consumer lease is that of a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in which the lessee resides at the time the lease agreement becomes enforceable or within 30 days thereafter or in which the goodsare to be used, the choice is not enforceable.
(2) If the judicial forum chosen by the parties to a consumer lease is a forum that would not otherwise have jurisdiction over the lessee, the choice is not enforceable.

§ 2A-107. WAIVER OR RENUNCIATION OF CLAIM OR RIGHT AFTER DEFAULT. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-106. LIMITATION ON POWER OF PARTIES TO CONSUMER LEASE TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW AND JUDICIAL FORUM.


This section of the law essentially states that if parties involved in a consumer lease agreement try to select a legal jurisdiction or court forum that is not within the lessee's area of residence or where the goods will be used, such a choice is not enforceable. This means that a lessor cannot force a lessee to abide by the laws of a foreign jurisdiction or to present themselves in a court that would not usually have power over them. The law, therefore, provides protection for consumers, preventing them from being taken advantage of by potentially manipulative jurisdiction or forum selections.


---

## § 2A-107. WAIVER OR RENUNCIATION OF CLAIM OR RIGHT AFTER DEFAULT.









Any claim or right arising out of an alleged default or breach of warranty may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by a written waiver or renunciation signed and delivered by the aggrieved party.

§ 2A-108. UNCONSCIONABILITY. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-107. WAIVER OR RENUNCIATION OF CLAIM OR RIGHT AFTER DEFAULT.


This section explains that if there has been a perceived failure to fulfill contractual obligations (default) or a breach of warranty (a guarantee about the quality or nature of a product or service), the party who feels wronged can relinquish their claim or right to recompense. This must be done in a written document, signed and delivered by that party, and it doesn't require any compensation or exchange.

In simpler terms, if you feel someone has broken a contract with you or breached a warranty, you can choose to give up your right to pursue legal action or compensation against them. This decision has to be made in writing and you have to sign it.

This is like choosing not to press charges after a crime has been committed against you. The power to make this decision lies solely with the wronged party. 

There doesn't seem to be a specific timeline associated with this rule, and it doesn't refer to any specific type of contract or warranty, thus indicating it's a general principle applicable to various leasing situations.


---

## § 2A-108. UNCONSCIONABILITY.










(1) If the court as a matter of law finds a lease contractor any clause of a lease contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the lease contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the lease contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
(2) With respect to a consumer lease, if the court as a matter of law finds that a lease contractor any clause of a lease contract has been induced by unconscionable conduct or that unconscionable conduct has occurred in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract, the court may grant appropriate relief.
(3) Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the lease contractor clause thereof, or of the conduct.
(4) In an action in which the lessee claims unconscionability with respect to a consumer lease:

(a) If the court finds unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the lessee.
(b) If the court does not find unconscionability and the lesseeclaiming unconscionability has brought or maintained an action he [or she] knew to be groundless, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the party against whom the claim is made.
(c) In determining attorney's fees, the amount of the recovery on behalf of the claimant under subsections (1) and (2) is not controlling.

§ 2A-109. OPTION TO ACCELERATE AT WILL. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-108. UNCONSCIONABILITY.


This section of law deals with "unconscionability," which refers to terms in a lease contract that are excessively unfair or unjust to one party. 

1) If a court finds any part of a lease contract to be unconscionable, it can either refuse to enforce the entire contract, enforce the contract minus the unconscionable terms, or limit the application of the unfair terms to avoid unjust outcomes.

2) In cases involving consumer leases, if a court determines that unconscionable conduct took place either in the formation of the contract or in the collection of a claim arising from it, the court has the power to grant appropriate relief.

3) Before making a ruling on unconscionability, the court must give the parties a fair chance to present evidence regarding the context, intent, and impact of the lease contract or clause, or of the conduct in question.

4) If a lessee (the person renting or leasing the property) alleges unconscionability in a consumer lease:

    a) If the court rules in favor of the lessee, it must award them reasonable attorney's fees.
    
    b) If the court does not find unconscionability and the lessee knew their claim was baseless, the court must award reasonable attorney's fees to the other party.
    
    c) When calculating attorney's fees, the amount of the claimant's recovery under the first two subsections is not the deciding factor.

This law is designed to protect parties, especially consumers, from being unfairly disadvantaged by lease contracts. Despite this, it also provides safeguards against groundless claims of unconscionability.

## § 2A-109. OPTION TO ACCELERATE AT WILL.










(1) A term providing that one party or his [or her] successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or "when he [or she] deems himself [or herself] insecure" or in words of similar import must be construed to mean that he [or she] has power to do so only if he [or she] in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.
(2) With respect to a consumer lease, the burden of establishing good faith under subsection (1) is on the party who exercised the power; otherwise the burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against whom the power has been exercised.

PART 2. FORMATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF LEASE CONTRACT ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-109. OPTION TO ACCELERATE AT WILL.


§ 2A-109 essentially states that if a lease contract contains a clause that allows one party or their successor to demand accelerated payment or performance, or require additional collateral if they feel "insecure", they can only exercise this power if they genuinely believe that the prospect of receiving payment or performance is at risk. It can't be done arbitrarily or without good reason. 

In the case of a consumer lease, the party who demands accelerated payment or performance, or additional collateral, has the burden of proving that they did so in good faith. If it is not a consumer lease, the party who is being demanded to accelerate payment or performance, or provide additional collateral, has the burden of proving that the other party acted in bad faith.

In simpler terms, this section is about "acceleration clauses" in leases. These are clauses that allow a party to demand full payment or performance early, often when they feel insecure about the other party's ability to fulfill their obligations. But this power can't be misused - it must be based on a real belief that payment or performance is in danger. If challenged, the party who demanded acceleration must be able to prove they had good reason to do so.

This rule is trying to prevent parties from abusing acceleration clauses, by requiring them to justify their decision to accelerate if challenged. It's a way of keeping things fair and preventing people from being taken advantage of.

## § 2A-201. STATUTE OF FRAUDS.










(1) A lease contractis not enforceable by way of action or defense unless:

(a) the total payments to be made under the lease contract, excluding payments for options to renew or buy, are less than $1,000; or
(b) there is a writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to describe the goods leased and the lease term.


(2) Any description of leased goods or of the leaseterm is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
(3) A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goodsshown in the writing.
(4) A lease contractthat does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), but which is valid in other respects, is enforceable:

(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor'sbusiness, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goodsadmitted; or
(c) with respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee.


(5) The lease term under a lease contractreferred to in subsection (4) is:

(a) if there is a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent specifying the leaseterm, the term so specified;
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court a leaseterm, the term so admitted; or
(c) a reasonable lease term.

### commentary on ## § 2A-201. STATUTE OF FRAUDS.


This section establishes the legal requirements for a lease contract to be enforceable. 

(1) A lease contract is only enforceable if: 
(a) the total payments are less than $1,000; or 
(b) the contract is in writing, signed by the party or their authorized agent, and includes a sufficient description of the leased goods and lease term.

(2) Any description can meet the requirements of subsection (1)(b) as long as it reasonably identifies the leased goods or lease term.

(3) A contract won't be deemed insufficient if it omits or incorrectly states a term. However, the contract cannot be enforced beyond the lease term and quantity of goods specified in the writing.

(4) Even if a lease contract doesn't meet the requirements of subsection (1), it can still be enforceable under certain circumstances. These include if the goods are specially made for the lessee, if the party admits in court that a contract was made, or if the goods have been received and accepted by the lessee.

(5) The lease term in such contracts is determined by a writing signed by the party, or admitted in court by the party, or if neither of those are available, it will be a reasonable lease term.

In simpler terms, this section outlines that, for a lease contract to be enforceable, it must either involve payments under $1,000, or it must be in writing and appropriately signed. However, there are exceptions where a contract can be enforced even if it doesn't meet these criteria. This includes situations where the leased goods are unique to the lessee or if the party admits to the contract in court. The lease term is determined by the written contract, court admission, or what would be considered reasonable.

## § 2A-202. FINAL WRITTEN EXPRESSION: PAROL OR EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE.









Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented:


(a)by course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance; and
(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

### commentary on ## § 2A-202. FINAL WRITTEN EXPRESSION: PAROL OR EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE.


This section addresses the final written expression of an agreement between parties. It states that the terms agreed upon in a written format are considered the final version and cannot be contradicted by any previous agreements or verbal discussions. However, these terms can be clarified or expanded upon by following the course of dealing or trade usage, or by the way the agreement has been carried out. 

The terms can also be supplemented with evidence of additional consistent terms, unless the court determines that the written agreement was intended to be the complete and exclusive statement of the terms.

For instance, if two parties had an oral agreement about renting a piece of equipment and later put their agreement in writing, they cannot later bring up terms from their oral agreement that contradict the written agreement. However, they could explain the terms in the written agreement based on how they've done business in the past, or they could add more terms to the agreement, as long as those terms don't contradict the original written terms.

In essence, this section safeguards the sanctity of written agreements and contracts, while also allowing some room for flexibility and adaptability based on real-world practices and additional consistent terms.

## § 2A-203. SEALS INOPERATIVE.









The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a lease contractor an offer to enter into a lease contract does not render the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to the lease contract or offer.

up
§ 2A-204. FORMATION IN GENERAL. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-203. SEALS INOPERATIVE.


The use of a seal on a lease contract or an offer to enter into a lease contract does not give the document any special status or protection under the laws typically applicable to sealed instruments. 

Analogy: Think of this like putting a fancy wax seal on a letter. The act of putting the seal doesn't magically make the content of the letter more important or unalterable. It's still just a letter.

Timeline events: This would come into play anytime a lease agreement or offer is being drawn up and a seal is used. Despite the seal's presence, it does not change the nature or legality of the agreement.

Commonly referred counterparts: This might be contrasted with situations where a seal does have legal implications, such as with a notary's seal, which carries its own set of legal implications and recognitions.

In essence, a seal on a lease contract or offer to a lease contract is purely decorative and does not change the legal standing or interpretation of the document.


---

## § 2A-204. FORMATION IN GENERAL.










(1) A lease contractmay be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a lease contract.
(2) An agreement sufficient to constitute a lease contractmay be found although the moment of its making is undetermined.
(3) Although one or more terms are left open, a lease contract does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a lease contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.

### commentary on ## § 2A-204. FORMATION IN GENERAL.


This section outlines how a lease contract may be formed. It states that the contract can be made in any manner that shows an agreement between the two parties, including actions that prove a contract exists. 

The second point states that even if it's unclear exactly when the contract was made, it can still be considered valid. 

The final part states that even if specific terms are left out or are unclear, the contract can still be valid as long as the parties intended to make a contract and there is a reasonable way to provide a resolution or remedy if needed. 

This essentially means that as long as there's a clear intent from both parties to enter into a lease contract, and there's a fair way to resolve any uncertainties or disputes, the actual specifics or timing of the contract are less important. This provides flexibility in the formation of lease contracts. 

Next section discusses about firm offers. If the seal is inoperative, it is mentioned in the previous section.

## § 2A-205. FIRM OFFERS.









An offer by a merchant to lease goodsto or from another person in a signed writing that by its terms gives assurance it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time, but in no event may the period of irrevocability exceed 3 months. Any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.




‹ § 2A-204. FORMATION IN GENERAL.
up
§ 2A-206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE IN FORMATION OF LEASE CONTRACT. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-205. FIRM OFFERS.


This section of the law relates to "firm offers" when leasing goods. It states that if a merchant makes an offer to lease goods and provides a written, signed guarantee that the offer will be kept open for a certain period, the offer cannot be revoked for lack of consideration during that period. If the offer does not specify a time period, it must be kept open for a reasonable amount of time, but not longer than three months. If the offer was made on a form provided by the offeree, the offeror must sign the term of assurance separately.

In simpler terms, if a merchant makes a written and signed offer to lease goods and promises to keep the offer open for a specific or reasonable time, they can't take back the offer during that period. They can't keep the offer open for more than three months, though. Also, if the merchant made the offer using a form given by the person they're offering to, they have to sign the promise to keep it open separately.

For example, imagine a car dealer offers to lease a car to a customer. They provide a written and signed offer, promising to keep it open for two weeks. Even if the customer doesn't give anything in return for this promise, the dealer can't revoke the offer during those two weeks. If they didn't specify a time, they'd have to keep the offer open for a reasonable amount of time. They couldn't keep it open for more than three months, though. Also, if the dealer used a form that the customer provided, they would need to sign the promise to keep the offer open separately.

## § 2A-206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE IN FORMATION OF LEASE CONTRACT.










(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances, an offer to make a lease contractmust be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.
(2) If the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance, an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.

§ 2A-207. COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR PRACTICAL CONSTRUCTION. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE IN FORMATION OF LEASE CONTRACT.


This clause in lease contracts essentially clarifies how offers and acceptances are to be interpreted. 

The first part (1) states that unless it's explicitly mentioned otherwise, an offer to lease is assumed to be open for acceptance in any reasonable manner and medium. This can be a verbal agreement, written contract, email, etc.

The second part (2) explains that if the beginning of the requested performance (e.g. starting to pay rent, moving into the property, etc.) is a reasonable way to accept the offer, the person who made the offer must be notified of this acceptance within a reasonable time. If not, they can assume that the offer has expired before it was accepted.

In simpler terms, this basically means that if you offer to lease your property to someone, they can accept in any reasonable way unless you specify otherwise. However, if their acceptance is through starting their lease (like paying rent or moving in), they need to let you know they've accepted your offer in a reasonable time frame or else you can assume they never accepted your offer.


---

## § 2A-207. COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR PRACTICAL CONSTRUCTION.










(1) If a lease contract involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is relevant to determine the meaning of the lease agreement.
(2) The express terms of a lease agreementand any course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but if that construction is unreasonable, express terms control course of performance, course of performance controls both course of dealing and usage of trade, and course of dealing controls usage of trade.
(3) Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-208 on modification and waiver, course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.





‹ § 2A-206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE IN FORMATION OF LEASE CONTRACT.

§ 2A-208. MODIFICATION, RESCISSION AND WAIVER. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-207. COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR PRACTICAL CONSTRUCTION.


This section essentially focuses on how actions taken during the course of a lease contract can influence the interpretation of that contract. If a party repeatedly behaves in a certain way without the other party objecting, that behavior becomes part of the interpretation of the contract. For example, if the lessee is consistently late on payments but the lessor never objects, this might be taken into account when interpreting the lease agreement in the future.

The law tries to reconcile the written terms of the lease with any behavior (course of performance) or established practices between the parties (course of dealing) or in the industry (usage of trade). However, if these cannot be aligned, the written terms of the lease are given priority, followed by course of performance, course of dealing, and then usage of trade.

Finally, the way parties behave during the lease can be used to show that they have waived or changed a term of the lease. For example, if a landlord never enforces a no-pets clause and allows the tenant to keep a dog, this could be seen as waiving that clause. However, any such waiver or modification is subject to the rules in Section 2A-208. 

In short, actions speak louder than words, but the words in the lease are still the loudest of all.

## § 2A-208. MODIFICATION, RESCISSION AND WAIVER.










(1) An agreement modifying a lease contractneeds no consideration to be binding.
(2) A signed lease agreementthat excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing may not be otherwise modified or rescinded, but, except as between merchants, such a requirement on a form supplied by a merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
(3) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2), it may operate as a waiver.
(4) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of a lease contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

### commentary on ## § 2A-208. MODIFICATION, RESCISSION AND WAIVER.


This section of the law focuses on lease contract modifications, rescissions, and waivers. Here's a breakdown:

1) Any modifications made to a lease contract do not require additional considerations (promises of payment or value) to be legally binding.

2) If a lease agreement is signed and explicitly states that modifications or rescissions can only be made through a signed written agreement, then any changes attempted otherwise are invalid. However, if such stipulations were made using a form provided by a merchant, the other party must sign the form separately for it to be valid, unless both parties are merchants.

3) Attempting modification or rescission that doesn't comply with subsection (2) might still function as a waiver, which is a voluntary surrender of a right or claim.

4) If a party has given a waiver affecting an unfulfilled part of the lease contract, they can withdraw the waiver by reasonably notifying the other party that they will require strict adherence to any term waived. However, they cannot retract the waiver if it would be unfair due to substantial changes made in reliance on the waiver.

In summary, this law section emphasizes the importance of clear, written communication when making changes to a lease contract. It also highlights the potential implications of a waiver, and the conditions under which it may be retracted.

## § 2A-209. LESSEE UNDER FINANCE LEASE AS BENEFICIARY OF SUPPLY CONTRACT.










(1) The benefit of a supplier's promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part of the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee's leasehold interest under a finance leaserelated to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising therefrom.
(2) The extension of the benefit of a supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee (Section 2A-209(1)) does not: (i) modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise, or (ii) impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee.
(3) Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission.
(4) In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection (1), the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law.

### commentary on ## § 2A-209. LESSEE UNDER FINANCE LEASE AS BENEFICIARY OF SUPPLY CONTRACT.


This section details how the benefits and warranties from a supply contract extended from a lessor to a lessee under a finance lease. 

1. The lessee benefits from the supplier's promises and warranties to the lessor, subject to the terms of the warranty and supply contract. Any defense or claim arising from the supply contract is also applicable to the lessee.

2. Despite the extension of these benefits and warranties, the lessee is not obligated to fulfill any duties or liabilities under the supply contract, nor does this change the rights or obligations of the supply contract's parties.

3. If the supply contract is modified or rescinded, this is only effective between the supplier and lessee if the supplier has been notified that the lessee has a finance lease related to the supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between supplier and lessee, any obligations that were modified or rescived are deemed to have been assumed by the lessor.

4. The lessee retains any rights they may have against the supplier, whether those rights arise from an agreement with the supplier or under other laws.

In simpler terms, this section spells out how a lessee can benefit from warranties and promises of the supplier under a finance lease without taking on any of the obligations under the supply contract. It also clarifies what happens if there are any changes to the supply contract.

## § 2A-210. EXPRESS WARRANTIES.










(1) Express warranties by the lessorare created as follows:

(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goodsand becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise.
(b) Any description of the goodswhich is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description.
(c) Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model.


(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant" or "guarantee," or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

### commentary on ## § 2A-210. EXPRESS WARRANTIES.


This section essentially details how express warranties, or explicit guarantees about a product's condition or quality, are created in a leasing agreement. 

The lessor, or the person who leases or rents a property to another, can create an express warranty in several ways:

- By affirming a fact or promising something about the goods that becomes part of the basis of the deal. In this case, the goods must live up to that affirmation or promise. 
- By giving a description of the goods as part of the agreement. The goods must then match that description. 
- By providing a sample or model as part of the agreement. The goods must then match that sample or model in its entirety.

Interestingly, the lessor does not need to use formal language or specifically intend to make a warranty for one to exist. However, a simple statement of the goods' value or a commendation of the goods does not constitute a warranty. 

This section thus serves as a caveat for lessors, who might unintentionally create express warranties, and a protection for lessees, who can rely on these warranties when entering into a lease agreement. 

This section appears before the next, which involves warranties against interference and infringement, and after the previous one, which discusses the lessee under a finance lease as the beneficiary of a supply contract.


---

## § 2A-211. WARRANTIES AGAINST INTERFERENCE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT; LESSEE's OBLIGATION AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.










(1) There is in a lease contract a warranty that for the lease term no person holds a claim to or interest in the goods that arose from an act or omission of the lessor, other than a claim by way of infringement or the like, which will interfere with the lessee's enjoyment of its leasehold interest.
(2) Except in a finance lease there is in a lease contract by a lessor who is a merchant regularly dealing in goodsof the kind a warranty that the goods are delivered free of the rightful claim of any person by way of infringement or the like.
(3) A lessee who furnishes specifications to a lessor or a supplier shall hold the lessor and the supplier harmless against any claim by way of infringement or the like that arises out of compliance with the specifications.

### commentary on ## § 2A-211. WARRANTIES AGAINST INTERFERENCE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT; LESSEE's OBLIGATION AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.


This section states that in a lease contract, the lessor guarantees that no one else has a claim or interest in the goods that would interfere with the lessee's use of them, unless the claim is for infringement. If the lessor is a merchant who regularly deals in the type of goods being leased, they must guarantee that the goods are delivered free of any rightful claim of infringement. If the lessee provides specifications to the lessor or supplier, the lessee must protect the lessor and supplier against any claim of infringement arising from compliance with those specifications.

## § 2A-212. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY.










(1) Except in a finance lease, a warranty that the goods will be merchantable is implied in a lease contract if the lessoris a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.
(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as

(a) pass without objection in the trade under the description in the lease agreement;
(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description;
(c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which goodsof that type are used;
(d) run, within the variation permitted by the lease agreement, of even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all units involved;
(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the lease agreementmay require; and
(f) conform to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label.


(3) Other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.

§ 2A-213. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-212. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY.


This law outlines the implied warranty of merchantability in lease agreements, except in financial leases. This warranty is automatically included if the lessor is a merchant of the type of goods involved in the lease.

For goods to be considered merchantable, they must meet certain criteria:

- They must be as described in the lease agreement and accepted in the trade.
- In the case of interchangeable goods, they must be of average quality.
- They must be fit for their ordinary purpose.
- They must be consistent in kind, quality, and quantity within and among all units involved.
- They must be properly packaged and labeled as per the lease agreement.
- They must meet any promises or affirmations made on the container or label.

The law also states that other implied warranties may come into play based on the course of dealing or trade usage.

In simple terms, this law ensures that when you lease something, it should be exactly as described and fit for its usual use. If it's not, you have legal grounds to complain.

The implication is that if you're a merchant leasing out goods, you need to ensure the goods are of good quality and as described, or you may face legal consequences. 

There are no major timeline events or counterparts related to this law, as it is a standard clause in leasing law. It is commonly paralleled in laws regarding the sale of goods, such as the Sale of Goods Act in the UK.

## § 2A-213. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.









Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contractan implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose.

§ 2A-214. EXCLUSION OR MODIFICATION OF WARRANTIES. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-213. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


This section pertains to the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose in a lease contract, excluding finance leases. The implied warranty indicates that the leased goods will be fit for the purpose the lessee intends to use them for, given that the lessor knew of this purpose at the time the lease contract was formed and the lessee is relying on the lessor’s expertise to provide suitable goods. 

This can be likened to hiring a personal trainer with the specific goal of running a marathon. You're relying on the trainer's expertise to provide a training plan suitable for this purpose. If the trainer knew of your goal from the start and you can't run more than a mile after months of training, it can be argued that the trainer has breached the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. 

A common counterpart that comes to mind is the implied warranty of merchantability, which is a slightly different concept. This ensures that the goods must at least be fit for the ordinary purpose for which such goods are used, as opposed to a specific purpose. 

This law about the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose has been a part of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for many years and is applicable in most U.S. jurisdictions. However, its interpretation can vary depending on specific state laws and court decisions.


---

## § 2A-214. EXCLUSION OR MODIFICATION OF WARRANTIES.










(1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but, subject to the provisions of Section 2A-202on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable.
(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention "merchantability", be by a writing, and be conspicuous. Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous and states, for example, "There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose".
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), but subject to subsection (4),

(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is," or "with all faults," or by other language that in common understanding calls the lessee'sattention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if in writing and conspicuous;
(b) if the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the goodsor the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed; and
(c) an implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.


(4) To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against infringement (Section 2A-211) or any part of it, the language must be specific, be by a writing, and be conspicuous, unless the circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject to a claim or interest of any person.

### commentary on ## § 2A-214. EXCLUSION OR MODIFICATION OF WARRANTIES.


This section of the law outlines the conditions under which warranties can be excluded or modified in a lease contract for goods.

1. If there are any contradictions between terms that create an express warranty and terms that negate or limit a warranty, they should be interpreted in a way that makes them consistent. However, if this interpretation is unreasonable, then the negation or limitation of warranty is not valid.

2. To exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability (the assumption that the goods are of reasonable quality and fit for their usual purpose), the contract must explicitly mention the term "merchantability", must be written, and must be clearly visible. 

3. The same rules apply for excluding or modifying the implied warranty of fitness (the assumption that the goods are fit for a specific purpose). The contract must clearly state that there is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose.

4. However, all implied warranties can be excluded with phrases like "as is" or "with all faults", or other language that clearly indicates the exclusion of warranties. If the lessee has inspected the goods prior to agreeing to the lease and failed to identify any defects, there is no implied warranty for those defects.

5. A warranty can also be excluded or modified based on previous dealings, performance or trade practices.

6. To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or infringement, the language must be specific, written, and conspicuous. This applies unless the circumstances, including previous dealings or performance, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are subject to a claim.

In simpler terms, this section highlights that to exclude or modify a warranty, the contract must be as clear as possible and explicitly state the exclusion or modification of the warranty. It also allows for warranties to be excluded based on past conduct or if the lessee should have been aware of any issues before the lease agreement.

## § 2A-215. CUMULATION AND CONFLICT OF WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.









Warranties, whether express or implied, must be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:

(a) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.
(b) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.
(c) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

### commentary on ## § 2A-215. CUMULATION AND CONFLICT OF WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.


The § 2A-215 clause in legal terms basically states that warranties, whether implied or directly stated, should be looked at as cumulative and in a manner that doesn't contradict each other. If that isn't possible, the intent of the parties involved will decide which warranty takes precedence. 

Several guidelines are laid out in the clause to determine that intent:

(a) If there are specific or technical specifications, these take precedence over any inconsistent samples, models, or general descriptor language.
(b) If a sample from a bulk product is provided, this displaces any inconsistent general language of description.
(c) Directly stated warranties replace any inconsistent implied warranties, except for the implied warranty that the product is suitable for a particular purpose.

Put simply, this section is all about managing conflicts between different types of warranties. It tries to establish a hierarchy of importance, where specific, technical descriptions and express warranties are given more weight than general descriptions or implied warranties. However, the suitability of a product for a specific purpose retains its weight even against express warranties.

<RD:"Subfile 1">Alternative A

A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this Article, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of the lessee or who is a guest in the lessee's home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section.

### commentary on ## § 2A-216. THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES.


This section of the code discusses third-party beneficiaries of express and implied warranties in lease agreements. It provides three alternatives for the extension of warranties.

Alternative A specifies that the warranty extends to any person in the lessee's family or household, or a guest in the lessee's home, if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use or be affected by the goods and is injured by a breach of warranty. However, this does not exclude other legal principles that may extend a warranty to other persons. Any exclusion, modification, or limitation against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary under this section.

Alternative B broadens the scope of the warranty to any natural person who may be reasonably expected to use or be affected by the goods and who is injured by breach of warranty. Similar to Alternative A, this does not displace other legal principles extending a warranty to other persons. Any exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty against the lessee is also effective against the beneficiary.

Alternative C extends the warranty to any person expected to use or be affected by the goods and is injured by a breach of warranty. It adds that this section cannot be excluded, modified, or limited with respect to injury to the person to whom the warranty extends, but any exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty against the lessee is also effective against the beneficiary.

This code section falls between § 2A-215, on the cumulation and conflict of warranties, and § 2A-217, on identification.


---

## § 2A-217. IDENTIFICATION.









Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contractrefers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs:

(a) when the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goodsthat are existing and identified;
(b) when the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a leaseof goods that are not existing and identified; or
(c) when the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals.

### commentary on ## § 2A-217. IDENTIFICATION.


This section pertains to the identification of goods in a lease contract. According to this, the parties involved can identify the goods at any time and in any way they mutually agree upon. If there's no explicit agreement regarding this, identification can happen in different ways: 

(a) at the time of making the lease contract if the goods exist and have already been identified
(b) when the goods are shipped, labeled or designated by the lessor (the person who leases or rents out the goods), if the goods don't exist and are unidentified at the time of making the lease contract
(c) in the case of lease contracts for unborn animals, identification happens at the time of conception. 

The previous section (§ 2A-216) pertains to third-party beneficiaries of express and implied warranties, while the next section (§ 2A-218) covers insurance and proceeds from a lease contract.


---

## § 2A-218. INSURANCE AND PROCEEDS.










(1) A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contracteven though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them.
(2) If a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified.
(3) Notwithstanding a lessee's insurable interest under subsections (1) and (2), the lessorretains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee.
(4) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.
(5) The parties by agreement may determine that one or more parties have an obligation to obtain and pay for insurance covering the goods and by agreement may determine the beneficiary of the proceeds of the insurance.

§ 2A-219. RISK OF LOSS. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-218. INSURANCE AND PROCEEDS.


This section dictates the rules around insurance and proceeds in a lease contract. 

1) The lessee has an insurable interest in the goods identified in the lease contract, even if those goods aren't in line with the contract and the lessee has the option to reject them. 

2) If the lessee's insurable interest is solely due to the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor can replace the identified goods with others until the lessee is in default or insolvent, or until the lessee is notified that the identification is final. 

3) Regardless of the lessee's insurable interest, the lessor retains their own insurable interest until the lessee exercises an option to buy, and the responsibility for loss has transferred to the lessee. 

4) This section doesn't limit any insurable interest recognized by other laws or statutes. 

5) The lease parties can agree on who has the obligation to get and pay for insurance on the goods, as well as who will receive the insurance proceeds. 

In simpler terms, this section outlines who holds the risk and responsibility for goods in a lease contract - the lessee, lessor, or both - and how this can change over time or based on certain conditions. It also allows for these responsibilities to be decided and adjusted by agreement between the parties involved.

## § 2A-219. RISK OF LOSS.










(1) Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee. In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee.
(2) Subject to the provisions of this Article on the effect of default on risk of loss (Section 2A-220), if risk of loss is to pass to the lesseeand the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply:

(a) If the lease contract requires or authorizes the goodsto be shipped by carrier

(i) and it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goodsare duly delivered to the carrier; but
(ii) if it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.


(b) If the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the lesseeon acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods.
(c) In any case not within subsection (a) or (b), the risk of loss passes to the lessee on the lessee's receipt of the goods if the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery.

§ 2A-220. EFFECT OF DEFAULT ON RISK OF LOSS. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-219. RISK OF LOSS.


This section of the law explains how the risk of loss is distributed in leasing contracts. 

The first point states that, unless it's a finance lease, the lessor, or the party leasing out the goods, holds the risk if the goods are lost or damaged. If it's a finance lease, where the lessee plans to buy the goods at the end of the lease, the lessee carries this risk.

The second point provides details on when the risk transfers to the lessee if it's not explicitly mentioned in the contract. 

If the contract involves shipping the goods, the risk passes to the lessee once the goods are delivered to the carrier, unless delivery at a specific destination is required. In this case, the risk transfers when the goods are delivered at that destination.

If the goods are held by a third party, or bailee, to be delivered without moving, the risk transfers to the lessee once the bailee confirms the lessee's right to possess the goods.

In other situations, the risk transfer depends on whether the lessor is a merchant. If they are, the risk transfers to the lessee once they receive the goods. If the lessor is not a merchant, the risk transfers at the point of delivery. 

This section essentially outlines who is responsible for the goods at different points in the leasing process.


---

## § 2A-220. EFFECT OF DEFAULT ON RISK OF LOSS.










(1) Where risk of loss is to pass to the lesseeand the time of passage is not stated:

(a) If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance.
(b) If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he [or she], to the extent of any deficiency in his [or her] effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning.


(2) Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his [or her] effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time.

### commentary on ## § 2A-220. EFFECT OF DEFAULT ON RISK OF LOSS.


This law essentially discusses who bears the risk of loss for leased goods when the lease agreement does not specify. 

In layman's terms:

1. If the goods delivered do not meet the terms of the lease (for example, if a rented car doesn't run), the person renting the goods (the lessee) can reject them, and the person who provided the goods (the lessor) bears the risk of loss. If the lessee has already accepted the goods but later revokes acceptance (maybe the rented car ran fine for a day but then stopped working), the lessee can treat the risk of loss as if it had always been with the lessor, but only to the extent that the lessee's insurance doesn't cover the loss.

2. If the lessee breaches the lease in some way (for example, by not paying rent) or refuses to accept the goods, the lessor or the supplier in a finance lease can place the risk of loss on the lessee for a reasonable period of time, again, only to the extent that the lessor or supplier's insurance doesn't cover the loss.

In summary, when a lease agreement doesn't specify who bears the risk of loss, this law provides guidelines based on whether the goods meet the lease agreement's terms and whether the lessee has breached the lease in some way.


---

## § 2A-221. CASUALTY TO IDENTIFIED GOODS.









If a lease contract requires goods identified when the lease contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of the lessee, the lessor or the supplier before delivery, or the goods suffer casualty before risk of loss passes to the lessee pursuant to the lease agreement or Section 2A-219, then:

(a) if the loss is total, the lease contractis avoided; and
(b) if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at his [or her] option either treat the lease contract as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor.

PART 3. EFFECT OF LEASE CONTRACT ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-221. CASUALTY TO IDENTIFIED GOODS.


This section covers situations where a leased item, which was specified and identified in the lease contract, suffers damage or loss through no fault of the lessee, the lessor, or the supplier, either before delivery or before the risk of loss is transferred to the lessee as per the lease terms or Section 2A-219. 

In such cases, if the loss is total, the lease contract gets nullified. If the loss is only partial or the goods have deteriorated to an extent that they no longer meet the requirements of the lease contract, the lessee still retains the right to inspect the goods. Based on this inspection, they can either opt to nullify the lease contract or choose to accept the goods with a suitable reduction in the lease payments for the remaining term of the lease to account for the deterioration or the shortfall in quantity. However, in the latter case, they cannot make any further claims against the lessor. This clause does not apply in the case of a finance lease unless it is a consumer lease.

In simpler terms, if a rented item gets damaged or lost before it's delivered to you or before you're officially responsible for it, and you, the company renting it out, or the manufacturer aren't to blame, then the rental agreement is void if the damage is total. If the damage is partial or the item isn't up to the standards laid out in the agreement, you can check out the item and then decide to either void the agreement or keep the item with a decrease in the rent to make up for the damage or shortage, but you can't make any additional claims against the company renting it out. This doesn't apply if it's a finance lease unless it's a consumer lease.

## § 2A-301. ENFORCEABILITY OF LEASE CONTRACT.









Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a lease contract is effective and enforceable according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the goodsand against creditors of the parties.

### commentary on ## § 2A-301. ENFORCEABILITY OF LEASE CONTRACT.


This section essentially states that a lease contract is binding and enforceable, as long as it is in accordance with the provisions of this Article. This means that the contract is valid between the parties involved, any potential buyers of the leased goods, and any creditors to whom the parties owe money. The only exceptions would be instances where this Article provides otherwise. 

In simpler terms, if you sign a lease contract, you, any future buyers of the leased goods, and anyone to whom you owe money, are all legally bound to the terms of that contract. The only way this wouldn't be true is if there’s a specific provision in this Article that says otherwise. 

As far as timeline events or commonly referred counterparts, this section doesn't specify any. It simply lays out the general rule that lease contracts are enforceable. 

This section could be thought of as the "stick to your word" segment of the Article. It's the part that says, if you've agreed to a contract and it's within the rules of this Article, you’re expected to stick to it. And not just you, but also anyone who buys the goods from you, and anyone to whom you owe money. 

This is a critical part of the legal framework that allows businesses to operate with a degree of certainty. Without enforceability, contracts would be meaningless.

## § 2A-302. TITLE TO AND POSSESSION OF GOODS.









Except as otherwise provided in this Article, each provision of this Article applies whether the lessor or a third party has title to the goods, and whether the lessor, the lessee, or a third party has possession of the goods, notwithstanding any statute or rule of law that possession or the absence of possession is fraudulent.

### commentary on ## § 2A-302. TITLE TO AND POSSESSION OF GOODS.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) states that all provisions included in this article apply regardless of who holds the title or possession of the leased goods. This is true whether it is the lessor (the person or company leasing the goods), the lessee (the person or company renting the goods), or a third party. This rule applies even if there are existing laws suggesting that possession or lack of it might be fraudulent.

This means that the rights and obligations outlined in this law apply to all parties involved in the leasing agreement, regardless of who technically owns or possesses the goods. The law is designed this way to ensure fairness and consistency in leasing transactions, so that all parties are held to the same standards and rules.

In essence, this law is saying: "it doesn't matter who owns the goods or who has them in their physical possession; the rules of this lease agreement apply to everyone involved." This allows for a certain level of security and predictability in leasing agreements, as all parties know what to expect and what is expected of them, regardless of the specifics of the agreement. 

The next section, § 2A-303, goes on to discuss the transferability of interests in a lease contract and the delegation of performance obligations. It outlines the rules for these situations, highlighting the rights and responsibilities of each party.

(1) As used in this section, "creation of a security interest" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to Article 9, Secured Transactions, by reason of Section 9-102(1)(b).
(2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), a provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection (5), but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective.
(3) A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits the creation or enforcement of a security interest in an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the provision or an actual delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the provision. Neither the granting nor the enforcement of a security interest in (i) the lessor'sinterest under the lease contract or (ii) the lessor's residual interest in the goods is a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the lessee within the purview of subsection (5) unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual delegation of a material performance of the lessor.
 (4) A provision in a lease agreement which (i) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contractor of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation , or (ii) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (5).
(5) Subject to subsections (3) and (4):

(a) if a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in Section 2A-501(2);
(b) if paragraph (a) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that (i) is prohibited under a lease agreement or (ii) materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, (i) the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.


 (6) A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease", or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.
 (7) Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default.
 (8) In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous.

### commentary on ## § 2A-303. ALIENABILITY OF PARTY's INTEREST UNDER LEASE CONTRACT OR OF LESSOR's RESIDUAL INTEREST IN GOODS; DELEGATION OF PERFORMANCE; TRANSFER OF RIGHTS.


This section of the law pertains to the transfer of rights and duties under a lease contract and the creation of security interests. It sets out the rights and remedies when a lease agreement prohibits or makes a transfer an event of default. 

To summarize each subsection:

1. Defines "creation of a security interest" as the sale of a lease contract under Article 9, Secured Transactions.

2. States that unless otherwise indicated, a lease provision prohibiting or making a transfer an event of default is effective, but gives rise to certain rights and remedies.

3. Specifies that a provision prohibiting the creation or enforcement of a security interest, or making such a transfer an event of default, is unenforceable unless there is an actual transfer violating the provision or an actual delegation of a key performance in violation of the provision.

4. States that a lease provision that prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default or a right to payment due to performance is unenforceable.

5. Provides the rights and remedies in the event of a transfer that breaches a lease agreement, or that materially alters the prospect of return performance, duty, or risk.

6. Defines a general transfer as a transfer of rights and a delegation of duties, unless context indicates otherwise.

7. States that, unless otherwise agreed, delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor of any duty to perform or liability for default.

8. Requires that in a consumer lease, any provision prohibiting the transfer of an interest under the lease contract or making a transfer an event of default must be specifically written and conspicuous.

Events or counterparts: This statute is a part of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a comprehensive set of laws governing commercial transactions in the United States. It is commonly invoked in cases involving lease contracts and disputes over the transfer of rights and duties.

## § 2A-304. SUBSEQUENT LEASE OF GOODS BY LESSOR.










(1) Subject to Section 2A-303, a subsequent lessee from a lessor of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and Section 2A-527(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessor with voidable title has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. If goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase, the lessor has that power even though:

(a) the lessor'stransferor was deceived as to the identity of the lessor;
(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored;
(c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale"; or
(d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.


(2) A subsequent lessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessor who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the existing lessee of that lessor before the interest of the subsequent lessee became enforceable against that lessor obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, all of that lessor's and the existing lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract.
(3) A subsequent lessee from the lessor of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.

### commentary on ## § 2A-304. SUBSEQUENT LEASE OF GOODS BY LESSOR.


This law outlines the rights and obligations of a subsequent lessee when a lessor leases goods under an existing lease contract. Essentially, the new lessee will get the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had the power to transfer, with a few exceptions.

Subsection 1 explains that a lessor with voidable title can transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee. This holds true even if the lessor's transferor was deceived about the identity of the lessor, the delivery was in exchange for a dishonored check, the transaction was supposed to be a "cash sale", or if the delivery was attained through fraud punishable under criminal law.

Subsection 2 states that if a subsequent lessee leases goods in the ordinary course of business from a merchant-lessor, the new lessee obtains all rights to the goods and is not bound by the existing lease contract. 

Subsection 3 says that a subsequent lessee will get no greater rights than those provided by this section and by the certificate of title statute if the goods are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title.

In layman's terms, this law sets out the rights a person has when they lease goods from someone who has already leased them from someone else. It says that the new lessee will usually get the same rights that the first lessee had. However, there are some exceptions, particularly when the goods are obtained in fraud or the transaction was supposed to be a "cash sale". 

A common example could be when you lease a car from a dealership that already leases it from a finance company. This law outlines your rights as the second lessee.

## § 2A-305. SALE OR SUBLEASE OF GOODS BY LESSEE.










(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-303, a buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessee had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and Section 2A-511(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessee with a voidable leasehold interest has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith buyer for value or a good faith sublessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of leasethe lessee has that power even though:

(a) the lessor was deceived as to the identity of the lessee;
(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or
(c) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.


(2) A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a sublessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessee who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the lessor obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, all of the lessor's and lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract.
(3) A buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.

### commentary on ## § 2A-305. SALE OR SUBLEASE OF GOODS BY LESSEE.


This section addresses the sale or sublease of goods by a lessee under an existing lease contract. 

The lessee can transfer their leasehold interest in the goods to a buyer or sublessee, but the transferred interest is subject to the existing lease contract. However, the lessee can transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith buyer or sublessee for value, even if the lessor has been deceived about the lessee's identity, the payment is made with a dishonored check, or if the delivery was procured through fraudulent means. 

If the lessee is a merchant dealing in such goods and was entrusted with the goods by the lessor, a buyer or sublessee in the ordinary course of business would obtain all of the lessor's and lessee's rights to the goods and would be free of the existing lease contract.

Buyers or sublessees of goods subject to an existing lease contract and covered by a certificate of title issued under state statute do not get any rights beyond those granted by this section and the certificate of title statute. 

In other words, if you buy or sublease goods from a lessee, you take on the lease terms unless the lessee is a merchant and you are an ordinary buyer. If the goods have a title certificate, your rights will be restricted according to that certificate and this section of the statute.

If a person in the ordinary course of his [or her] business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a lease contract, a lien upon those goods in the possession of that person given by statute or rule of law for those materials or services takes priority over any interest of the lessor or lesseeunder the lease contract or this Article unless the lien is created by statute and the statute provides otherwise or unless the lien is created by rule of law and the rule of law provides otherwise.

### commentary on ## § 2A-306. PRIORITY OF CERTAIN LIENS ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW.


This section of the law provides that if a person provides services or materials for goods that are part of a lease contract, and they have a lien (a legal claim) on the goods, their claim takes precedence over any interest from the lessor (the one who rents out the goods) or the lessee (the one who rents the goods) under the lease contract. This is unless the lien is created by statute and the statute says differently, or if the lien is created by a rule of law that requires otherwise.

In simpler terms, this law prioritizes the claims of those who provide services or materials to goods under lease over the interests of the lease contract parties, unless other specific law rules say otherwise.

This is akin to a mechanic who fixes a car that's under a lease. The mechanic's claim for payment for their services would take priority over the interests of the leasing company or the person leasing the car, unless there's a specific law that says differently.

### commentary on ## § 2A-307. PRIORITY OF LIENS ARISING BY ATTACHMENT OR LEVY ON, SECURITY INTERESTS IN, AND OTHER CLAIMS TO GOODS.


This section outlines the priority of claims over leased goods, specifically considering instances when a lessee or lessor has outstanding debts.

(1) Generally, if a lessee owes money to a creditor, the lease contract remains in place, i.e., the creditor can't disrupt the lease to collect on the debt.

(2) Similarly, if a lessor owes money to a creditor, the lease contract is still in effect, unless:
    (a) the creditor has a lien (a legal claim for unpaid debt) on the goods before the lease contract was enforceable,
    (b) the creditor has a security interest or claim in the goods, and the lessee didn't pay and receive the goods without knowing about this claim, or
    (c) the creditor’s security interest was established before the lease contract was enforceable.

(3) If a lessee, in the normal course of business, leases goods that have a security interest or claim attached to them by the lessor, the lessee is not liable for that claim, even if they are aware of the claim.

(4) If a lessee, who is not leasing the goods in the normal course of business, leases goods that have a security interest or claim attached to them, the lessee is still not liable for the claim. However, there are exceptions if the lessor has a security interest that secures future advances made after the secured party finds out about the lease or if the lease contract becomes enforceable after 45 days.

In simpler terms, the aim of this section is to protect the rights of lessees from creditors who have claims against the lessor, except under certain conditions. It also provides some protection to creditors who have been granted security interests or liens before a lease agreement is put into effect.

## § 2A-308. SPECIAL RIGHTS OF CREDITORS.










(1) A creditor of a lessor in possession of goods subject to a lease contractmay treat the lease contract as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the lessor is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by the lessor for a commercially reasonable time after the lease contract becomes enforceable is not fraudulent.
(2) Nothing in this Article impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if the lease contract(a) becomes enforceable, not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a pre-existing claim for money, security, or the like, and (b) is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule of law apart from this Article would constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.
(3) A creditor of a seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession of the goods pursuant to a lease contract entered into by the seller as lessee and the buyer as lessor in connection with the sale or identification of the goods is not fraudulent if the buyer bought for value and in good faith.

### commentary on ## § 2A-308. SPECIAL RIGHTS OF CREDITORS.


This section details the special rights of creditors in relation to lease contracts and fraudulent transactions. 

Section 1 states that if a lessor retains possession of goods under a lease contract in a manner that is deemed fraudulent according to any law or statute, a creditor of the lessor can treat the lease contract as invalid. However, if the lessor retains possession in good faith and follows the current course of trade for a commercially reasonable time after the lease contract is enforceable, it isn't considered fraudulent.

Section 2 emphasizes that the rights of creditors aren't affected by this article if the lease contract becomes enforceable not in the current course of trade, but as a means to satisfy or secure a pre-existing claim for money, security, or similar. The lease contract can be considered a fraudulent transaction or voidable preference under certain circumstances as per any rule or law apart from this article.

Section 3 explains that a creditor of a seller can deem a sale or identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if the seller retains possession in a fraudulent manner as per any law or statute. But, if the possession of goods is retained under a lease contract in good faith, and the buyer bought for value, it is not considered fraudulent.

In simplistic terms, this law is aimed to protect creditors from fraudulent transactions while ensuring that genuine transactions are not unfairly targeted. The law outlines when a transaction can be considered fraudulent, but also provides exceptions for instances where the goods remain with the seller or lessor in a legitimate manner.

(1) In this section:

(a) goodsare "fixtures" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law;
(b) a "fixture filing" is the filing, in the office where a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded , of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of Section 9-402(5);
(c) a lease is a "purchase money lease" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreementis enforceable;
(d) a mortgage is a "construction mortgage" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates; and
(e) "encumbrance" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests.


(2) Under this Article a lease may be of goodsthat are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this Article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.
(3) This Article does not prevent creation of a leaseof fixtures pursuant to real estate law.
(4) The perfected interest of a lessorof fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:

(a) the lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within ten days thereafter, and the lesseehas an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; or
(b) the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.


(5) The interest of a lessorof fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:

(a) the fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contractis enforceable; or
(b) the conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contractis enforceable; or
(c) the encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goodsas fixtures; or
(d) the lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.


(6) Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) but otherwise subject to subsections (4) and (5), the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goodsbecome fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.
(7) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lesseeis determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.
(8) If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this Article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this Article, remove the goodsfrom the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.
(9) Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).

### commentary on ## § 2A-309. LESSOR's AND LESSEE's RIGHTS WHEN GOODS BECOME FIXTURES.


This section sets out the rights of the the lessor and the lessee when goods become fixtures on a piece of real estate. Fixtures are defined as goods that become so intrinsically linked to a piece of real estate that they form part of the real estate interest. The section establishes that leases can be created for goods that are or will become fixtures, but not for ordinary building materials that are incorporated into an improvement on land.

The section sets out the priority of interests when conflicts arise between a lessor’s and an encumbrancer’s interests in the fixtures. The lessor’s interest will typically have priority if the lease is a purchase money lease and the lessor’s interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within ten days thereafter. The lessor’s interest also has priority if the conflicting interest is a lien obtained after the lease contract is enforceable, or if the encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures. 

However, the lessor’s interest is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before construction is complete. 

The lessor or lessee may remove the goods from the real estate if the lessor’s interest has priority over all conflicting interests, subject to certain conditions, such as reimbursement for any physical damage caused by the removal. The lessor’s interest in the fixtures can be perfected by filing a financing statement.

## § 2A-310. LESSOR's AND LESSEE's RIGHTS WHEN GOODS BECOME ACCESSIONS.










(1) Goods are "accessions" when they are installed in or affixed to other goods.
(2) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goodsbecame accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4).
(3) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4) but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the leaseor disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole.
(4) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contractdescribed in subsection (2) or (3) is subordinate to the interest of

(a) a buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goodsbecame accessions; or
(b) a creditor with a security interest in the whole perfected before the lease contract was made to the extent that the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract.


(5) When under subsections (2) or (3) and (4) a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may (a) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this Article, or (b) if necessary to enforce his [or her] other rights and remedies under this Article, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he [or she] must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.

### commentary on ## § 2A-310. LESSOR's AND LESSEE's RIGHTS WHEN GOODS BECOME ACCESSIONS.


This section outlines the rights of lessors (those who lease out goods) and lessees (those who lease goods) when the leased goods become accessions. 

Accessions are goods that are attached or fixed to other goods. According to this section, the interest of a lessor or lessee in a lease contract is generally superior to all other interests in the whole (the combined goods), unless stated otherwise in subsection (4). 

Subsection (4) specifies two exceptions where the lessor or lessee's interest is subordinate: to a buyer or lessee in ordinary business who acquires interest in the whole after the goods became accessions, and to a creditor with a security interest in the whole that was perfected before the lease contract was made, as long as the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract.

Finally, subsection (5) allows a lessor or lessee, under specific conditions, to remove the goods from the whole. If removal causes any physical damages, they must reimburse the holder of an interest in the whole for the cost of repairs, but not for any decrease in value due to the absence of the goods or the necessity of replacing them.

In layman's terms, if you lease something and it gets attached to something else, your lease contract usually takes priority over other interests in the combined goods, unless the other party is a regular buyer or a creditor who was already involved before the lease contract was signed. If you need to remove the leased goods, you'll have to pay for any physical damages, but not for any loss in value due to removal or replacement.

### commentary on ## § 2A-311. PRIORITY SUBJECT TO SUBORDINATION.


This section of the Article states that despite any established priority or hierarchy, any person with the right of priority can choose to subordinate, or lower, their position via agreement. In other words, even if a person or party is entitled to have their interests or rights considered before others, they can willingly accept a lower rank if they agree to it.

For example, if person A has a priority right to a piece of property over person B, under this provision, person A can choose to subordinate their rights and allow person B to have priority, as long as they agree to it. 

This provision might be used in situations where there are complex negotiations or arrangements, or where a person or party decides it is in their best interest to allow someone else to have priority. As with other legal decisions, this would likely involve careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks.

## § 2A-401. INSECURITY: ADEQUATE ASSURANCE OF PERFORMANCE.










(1) A lease contractimposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired.
(2) If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he [or she] has not already received the agreed return.
(3) A repudiation of the lease contractoccurs if assurance of due performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is not provided to the insecure party within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days after receipt of a demand by the other party.
(4) Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards.
(5) Acceptance of any nonconforming delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.

### commentary on ## § 2A-401. INSECURITY: ADEQUATE ASSURANCE OF PERFORMANCE.


§ 2A-401 discusses the expectation of due performance in a lease contract, i.e., each party expects the other to fulfill their respective obligations under the lease. 

If any party becomes insecure about the other's ability to meet their obligations (perhaps due to financial problems, delay in performance, or other reasonable grounds), they can demand written assurance of due performance. The insecure party can withhold their own performance until such assurance is received, provided this is commercially reasonable.

If the party in question fails to provide the necessary assurance within a reasonable timeframe (not exceeding 30 days from the date of demand), it is considered a repudiation of the lease contract, which can lead to legal consequences such as termination of the contract or a lawsuit for damages.

For businesses (merchants), the grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of the assurance provided are judged based on commercial standards.

Importantly, if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery or payment, it doesn't waive their right to demand adequate assurance for future performance. This means, they can still hold the other party accountable for any future breaches of the contract.

In simple terms, this section is about protecting parties in a lease contract when there's doubt about the other's ability to fulfill their contractual duties. It allows for temporary suspension of own duties and an option to demand assurance of performance. Failure to provide such assurance can be seen as an anticipatory breach of the contract.

## § 2A-402. ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION.









If either party repudiates a lease contractwith respect to a performance not yet due under the lease contract, the loss of which performance will substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the other, the aggrieved party may:

(a)for a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party;
(b) make demand pursuant to Section 2A-401and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case; or
(c) resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this Article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party's performance and assurance and has urged retraction. In addition, whether or not the aggrieved party is pursuing one of the foregoing remedies, the aggrieved party may suspend performance or, if the aggrieved party is the lessor, proceed in accordance with the provisions of this Article on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract notwithstanding default or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2A-524).

### commentary on ## § 2A-402. ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION.


This section outlines the legal options available to a party when the other party repudiates a lease contract regarding a significant future performance. The aggrieved party can:

(a) wait for a reasonable time for the repudiating party to retract the repudiation and fulfil their obligations;
(b) according to Section 2A-401, demand and wait for adequate assurance of future performance based on the specific circumstances; or
(c) use any right or remedy available upon default under the lease contract or this Article, even if they have informed the repudiating party they will wait for their performance and assurance and requested retraction. Additionally, the aggrieved party can suspend their own performance or, if they are the lessor, proceed according to this Article's provisions on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract despite default or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2A-524). 

In simpler terms, if one party breaks a lease contract regarding a yet-to-be-performed significant action, the other party can either wait for them to correct their mistake, demand assurance that they will fulfil their obligations, or invoke any applicable remedies. They can also stop their own performance or, if they are the lessor, carry on with certain actions such as identifying goods related to the contract even if the other party has defaulted, or salvage unfinished goods.

## § 2A-403. RETRACTION OF ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION.










(1) Until the repudiating party's next performance is due, the repudiating party can retract the repudiation unless, since the repudiation, the aggrieved party has cancelled the lease contractor materially changed the aggrieved party's position or otherwise indicated that the aggrieved party considers the repudiation final.
(2) Retraction may be by any method that clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform under the lease contract and includes any assurance demanded under Section 2A-401.
(3) Retraction reinstates a repudiating party's rights under a lease contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.

This section of the Uniform Commercial Code is about taking back a previous declaration of intention to breach a lease contract, also known as anticipatory repudiation. 

In simpler terms, if a person or company indicates they're not going to fulfill their obligations under a lease contract before the time to perform those obligations is due (anticipatory repudiation), this section says they can change their mind and decide to fulfill the contract after all (retraction). 

There are, however, conditions for this retraction to be valid. The repudiating party can only retract their repudiation until their next performance under the contract is due. Furthermore, the aggrieved party (the other party to the contract) must not have already taken action in response to the repudiation, like cancelling the contract or making significant changes to their position. 

The retraction can be made in any way that clearly communicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to fulfill their obligations under the contract. This could even include providing any assurance requested under Section 2A-401. 

When a retraction is made, it restores the rights of the repudiating party under the contract, but takes into account any delay caused by the initial repudiation, giving the aggrieved party the right to some form of compensation. 

So, in a nutshell, if someone says they're going to break a lease contract but changes their mind before their next responsibility under the contract is due, and if the other party hasn't already reacted to the potential breach, they can take back their declaration and carry on with the contract as normal.

## § 2A-404. SUBSTITUTED PERFORMANCE.










(1) If without fault of the lessee, the lessor and the supplier, the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or the agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable, but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, the substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.
(2) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation:

(a) the lessor may withhold or stop delivery or cause the supplier to withhold or stop delivery unless the lesseeprovides a means or manner of payment that is commercially a substantial equivalent; and
(b) if delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the lessee's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive, or predatory.

### commentary on ## § 2A-404. SUBSTITUTED PERFORMANCE.


This section pertains to the circumstances when the agreed mode of delivery or payment becomes unavailable or impractical due to no fault of the lessee, lessor, or supplier. If this happens but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, it must be used. In case the agreed means of payment fails due to governmental regulations, the lessor may withhold delivery unless the lessee provides a commercially equivalent method of payment. If delivery has already happened, payment by the means provided by the regulation discharges the lessee's obligation, unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive, or predatory. 

In layman's terms, if the delivery or payment plan originally agreed upon can't be followed for reasons outside everyone's control, a reasonable substitute should be used. If the payment method fails because of government rules, the lessor can hold back the delivery until a new payment plan is provided, or if the delivery is already done, payment through the method the government set will fulfills the lessee's responsibility unless the rule unfairly targets specific groups.

## § 2A-405. EXCUSED PERFORMANCE.









Subject to Section 2A-404on substituted performance, the following rules apply:

(a) Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a lessor or a supplier who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a default under the lease contractif performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the lease contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order, whether or not the regulation or order later proves to be invalid.
(b) If the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only part of the lessor's or the supplier's capacity to perform, he [or she] shall allocate production and deliveries among his [or her] customers but at his [or her] option may include regular customers not then under contract for sale or leaseas well as his [or her] own requirements for further manufacture. He [or she] may so allocate in any manner that is fair and reasonable.
(c) The lessor seasonably shall notify the lessee and in the case of a finance lease the supplier seasonably shall notify the lessor and the lessee, if known, that there will be delay or nondelivery and, if allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the lessee.

§ 2A-406. PROCEDURE ON EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-405. EXCUSED PERFORMANCE.


This section of the law refers to situations where a lessor or supplier is excused from delivering goods under a lease contract due to circumstances beyond their control, such as unforeseen events or regulatory changes. 

These rules state that if a lessor or supplier's ability to fulfill the contract is made impracticable by unforeseen events or regulatory changes, then they are not in default of the contract. However, they must comply with two conditions: if only part of their capacity to perform is affected, they must fairly allocate their remaining capacity among their customers, and they must also promptly notify the lessee and, if applicable, the supplier, of any delay or nondelivery. 

For instance, if a furniture leasing company had a massive warehouse fire, it might not be able to fulfill all its existing lease contracts. According to this law, as long as the company fairly allocates its remaining inventory to its customers and promptly notifies them of the delay or nondelivery, it won't be in default of the contracts.

In a real-world scenario, this section could've been invoked by suppliers during the COVID-19 pandemic, where global supply chains were disrupted by unforeseen circumstances beyond their control.

## § 2A-406. PROCEDURE ON EXCUSED PERFORMANCE.










(1) If the lessee receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under Section 2A-405, the lessee may by written notification to the lessor as to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (Section 2A-510):

(a) terminate the lease contract (Section 2A-505(2)); or
(b) except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, modify the lease contract by accepting the available quota in substitution, with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deficiency but without further right against the lessor.


(2) If, after receipt of a notification from the lessor under Section 2A-405, the lessee fails so to modify the lease agreement within a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days, the lease contract lapses with respect to any deliveries affected.

### commentary on ## § 2A-406. PROCEDURE ON EXCUSED PERFORMANCE.


This section outlines the procedures for instances when performance under a lease contract is excused.

1) If a lessee receives a notification about a material or indefinite delay or allocation under Section 2A-405, they can respond to the lessor in writing. If the value of the entire lease contract is significantly impaired under an installment lease contract, the lessee may:
   a) Terminate the lease contract under Section 2A-505(2), or
   b) Modify the lease contract to accept an available quota in substitution. The lessee would then receive a due allowance from the rent for the remaining lease term for the deficiency but will have no further rights against the lessor. However, this modification option isn't available in a finance lease that isn't a consumer lease.

2) If the lessee does not modify the lease agreement within a reasonable timeframe (not exceeding 30 days) after receiving the notification from the lessor under Section 2A-405, the lease contract becomes void for any impacted deliveries. 

To put it in simpler terms, this section is like a plan B for a lessee if a lessor notifies them about a significant delay or change. The lessee can either cancel the contract or modify it, based on what works best for them. However, they need to decide within 30 days, or they lose the ability to make changes for any affected deliveries.

## § 2A-407. IRREVOCABLE PROMISES: FINANCE LEASES.










(1) In the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease the lessee's promises under the lease contract become irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods.
(2) A promise that has become irrevocable and independent under subsection (1):

(a) is effective and enforceable between the parties, and by or against third parties including assignees of the parties ; and
(b) is not subject to cancellation, termination, modification, repudiation, excuse, or substitution without the consent of the party to whom the promise runs.


(3) This section does not affect the validity under any other law of a covenant in any lease contract making the lessee's promises irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods.

PART 5. DEFAULT ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-407. IRREVOCABLE PROMISES: FINANCE LEASES.


This section of UCC Article 2A essentially refers to the legal obligations of a lessee in a finance lease, which is not a consumer lease. Once the lessee accepts the goods, their promises under the lease contract become irrevocable, meaning they cannot be taken back, and independent, meaning they operate separately from any other promises or conditions.

In simpler terms, this law states that once a lessee agrees to the terms of a finance lease and accepts the goods, they are legally bound to their promises under the contract. This can include things like making regular payments or maintaining the condition of the leased goods. These promises cannot be cancelled, terminated, modified, or substituted unless the party to which the promises were made (usually the lessor) agrees.

To put it in a metaphorical context, this law is like ordering a meal in a restaurant: once you've ordered and the food is served, you are obligated to pay for it. You can't decide halfway through that you actually wanted something else and refuse to pay.

This section also clarifies that it does not affect the legality of any promise in a lease contract that is made irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods, under any other law. This means if there are other laws that allow for such promises to be made, this section does not invalidate those laws. 

Overall, this section emphasizes the importance of the lessee understanding and agreeing to the terms of a finance lease before accepting the goods, as once they do, they are legally bound to fulfill their promises, regardless of any changes in circumstances.

## § 2A-501. DEFAULT: PROCEDURE.










(1) Whether the lessor or the lessee is in default under a lease contract is determined by the lease agreementand this Article.
(2) If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement has rights and remedies as provided in this Article and, except as limited by this Article, as provided in the lease agreement.
(3) If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement may reduce the party's claim to judgment, or otherwise enforce the lease contract by self-help or any available judicial procedure or nonjudicial procedure, including administrative proceeding, arbitration, or the like, in accordance with this Article.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in Section 1-106(1) or this Article or the lease agreement, the rights and remedies referred to in subsections (2) and (3) are cumulative.
(5) If the lease agreement covers both real property and goods, the party seeking enforcement may proceed under this Part as to the goods, or under other applicable law as to both the real property and the goods in accordance with that party's rights and remedies in respect of the real property, in which case this Part does not apply.

### commentary on ## § 2A-501. DEFAULT: PROCEDURE.


This section outlines the procedures and rights of the parties (lesser or lessee) in case of a default under a lease contract. The default is determined based on the lease agreement and the provisions of this Article. The party seeking enforcement of the contract has several rights and remedies, including reducing their claim to judgment, self-help, or using any available judicial or non-judicial procedure. These remedies are cumulative unless otherwise specified in the agreement or this Article. If the lease agreement involves both real property and goods, the enforcing party can choose to proceed under this Part for the goods, or according to other applicable laws for both the goods and the real property.


---

## § 2A-502. NOTICE AFTER DEFAULT.









Except as otherwise provided in this Article or the lease agreement, the lessor or lessee in default under the lease contractis not entitled to notice of default or notice of enforcement from the other party to the lease agreement.

### commentary on ## § 2A-502. NOTICE AFTER DEFAULT.


This section states that unless it is otherwise stated in the lease agreement or in another part of this law, a party who has defaulted on their obligations under the lease agreement is not entitled to receive any form of notice from the other party, either about the default or about any measures being taken to enforce the lease agreement. 

Essentially, if you fail to meet your obligations under a lease agreement, you can't expect to get a warning or notification from the other party before they take action to enforce the agreement. This could be compared to a student who fails to study for an exam and then gets upset when they fail – they can't expect the teacher to give them a warning or a second chance. Or it could be likened to a player in a sport who breaks the rules and then is surprised when they receive a penalty without warning. 

This kind of provision is common in many types of contracts and is designed to help maintain the integrity of the agreement and to deter parties from neglecting their responsibilities.


---

## § 2A-503. MODIFICATION OR IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.










(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the lease agreementmay include rights and remedies for default in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article.
(2) Resort to a remedy provided under this Article or in the lease agreementis optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive. If circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, or provision for an exclusive remedy is unconscionable, remedy may be had as provided in this Article.
(3) Consequential damages may be liquidated under Section 2A-504, or may otherwise be limited, altered, or excluded unless the limitation, alteration, or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation, alteration, or exclusion of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goodsis prima facie unconscionable but limitation, alteration, or exclusion of damages where the loss is commercial is not prima facie unconscionable.
(4) Rights and remedies on default by the lessor or the lessee with respect to any obligation or promise collateral or ancillary to the lease contract are not impaired by this Article.

§ 2A-504. LIQUIDATION OF DAMAGES. ›







### commentary on ## § 2A-503. MODIFICATION OR IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.


This section essentially states that the lease agreement can include additional rights and remedies for default, beyond what is stipulated in this Article. However, these additions can't hinder the rights and remedies provided in the Article.

If a lease agreement outlines a particular remedy to be the only course of action (an exclusive remedy), this can be enforced unless the remedy fails to serve its core purpose or if it is deemed unconscionable. If this happens, remedies as provided in this Article may be pursued instead.

The section also allows for consequential damages to be liquidated, limited, altered, or excluded, unless such action is deemed unconscionable. In the case of consumer goods, any limitation or exclusion of consequential damages for personal injuries is typically seen as unconscionable. However, when it comes to commercial losses, limitations or exclusions are not necessarily seen as unconscionable.

Lastly, this section assures that any rights and remedies related to any collateral or ancillary obligations or promises linked to the lease contract aren't impaired by this Article.

In simpler terms, this section assures both the lessor and the lessee that the lease agreement can provide more options for default, it can limit damages, and it won't interfere with any side agreements tied to the lease. However, it does stress that any remedies or limitations can't be unconscionable or fail of their essential purpose.


---

## § 2A-504. LIQUIDATION OF DAMAGES.










(1) Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in the lease agreementbut only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or omission.
(2) If the lease agreementprovides for liquidation of damages, and such provision does not comply with subsection (1), or such provision is an exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Article.
(3) If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of the lessee's default or insolvency (Section 2A-525 or 2A-526), the lessee is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his [or her] payments exceeds:

(a) the amount to which the lessoris entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the lessor's damages in accordance with subsection (1); or
(b) in the absence of those terms, 20 percent of the then present value of the total rent the lessee was obligated to pay for the balance of the lease term, or, in the case of a consumer lease, the lesser of such amount or $500.


(4) A lessee's right to restitution under subsection (3) is subject to offset to the extent the lessorestablishes:

(a) a right to recover damages under the provisions of this Article other than subsection (1); and
(b) the amount or value of any benefits received by the lessee directly or indirectly by reason of the lease contract.

### commentary on ## § 2A-504. LIQUIDATION OF DAMAGES.


This section of the law outlines the rules for liquidated damages in lease agreements. Liquidated damages are a pre-determined amount of money that one party agrees to pay the other in the event of a breach of contract. 

The law states that the amount of liquidated damages must be reasonable and reflect the anticipated harm caused by the breach. If a lease agreement includes provisions for liquidated damages that don't meet these criteria, or if the provision fails to serve its intended purpose due to circumstances, the harmed party may seek other remedies as outlined in the law.

This section also addresses situations where the lessor (the person or company leasing out the property) rightfully withholds or stops delivery of goods due to the lessee's (the person or company leasing the property) default or insolvency. In such cases, the lessee is entitled to a refund of any payments that exceed the amount of liquidated damages or, in the absence of such terms, 20% of the total rent they were obligated to pay for the remainder of the lease term, or $500 in case of a consumer lease, whichever is less.

However, this right to restitution is subject to offset if the lessor can prove they have the right to recover damages under other sections of the law or if the lessee has enjoyed any benefits from the lease contract directly or indirectly.
  
To put it simply, this law outlines how and when a party can claim pre-determined damages in case of a breach of a lease agreement and how the lessee can claim their money back if the lessor unjustifiably stops the delivery of goods.

## § 2A-505. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF CANCELLATION, TERMINATION, RESCISSION, OR FRAUD ON RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.










(1) On cancellation of the lease contract, all obligations that are still executory on both sides are discharged, but any right based on prior default or performance survives, and the cancelling party also retains any remedy for default of the whole lease contract or any unperformed balance.
(2) On termination of the lease contract, all obligations that are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior default or performance survives.
(3) Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of "cancellation,"rescission," or the like of the lease contractmay not be construed as a renunciation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent default.
(4) Rights and remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all rights and remedies available under this Article for default.
(5) Neither rescission nor a claim for rescission of the lease contract nor rejection or return of the goods may bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other right or remedy.

(1) When a lease contract is cancelled, all future obligations on both sides are dissolved. However, rights resulting from prior breaches or performance remain, and the cancelling party can still seek remedies for breach of the entire contract or any unfulfilled parts.

(2) Upon termination of a lease agreement, all future obligations from either party are dissolved. But, any rights arising from previous breaches or performance are still valid.

(3) Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, terms like "cancellation" or "rescission" of the lease contract do not imply a waiver or discharge of any claims for damages due to previous breaches.

(4) Rights and remedies for significant misrepresentation or fraud include all rights and remedies offered under this Article for a breach of the contract.

(5) Rescission or a claim for rescission of the lease contract or rejection or return of the goods do not negate or conflict with a claim for damages or other right or remedy.

This article basically outlines what happens when a lease contract gets cancelled or terminated, making it clear that any rights or claims arising from past breaches or performances are not affected. It also emphasizes that terms like "cancellation" or "rescission" do not waive any claims for damages. Additionally, it states that rights and remedies for significant misrepresentation or fraud are the same as for a breach of contract, and that rescission or rejection of goods does not hinder the right to claim damages.

## § 2A-506. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.










(1) An action for default under a lease contract, including breach of warranty or indemnity, must be commenced within 4 years after the cause of action accrued. By the original lease contract the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year.
(2) A cause of action for default accrues when the act or omission on which the default or breach of warranty is based is or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party, or when the default occurs, whichever is later. A cause of action for indemnity accrues when the act or omission on which the claim for indemnity is based is or should have been discovered by the indemnified party, whichever is later.
(3) If an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same default or breach of warranty or indemnity, the other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within 6 months after the terminationof the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.
(4) This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action that have accrued before this Article becomes effective.

### commentary on ## § 2A-506. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.


This statute sets a four-year limit for filing a lawsuit in case of default or breach of warranty or indemnity under a lease contract. However, the parties involved in the contract can agree to reduce this period, but not less than one year. The cause of action accrues when the aggrieved party discovers, or should have discovered, the act or omission leading to default or breach. If the first action undertaken within the time limit doesn't result in a remedy, another action can be initiated within six months after the termination of the first one. This statute doesn't apply to causes of action that have accrued before its enactment. This doesn't change the law on suspending the statute of limitations.

(1) Damages based on market rent (Section 2A-519 or 2A-528) are determined according to the rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times specified in Sections 2A-519 and 2A-528.
(2) If evidence of rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreementand prevailing at the times or places described in this Article is not readily available, the rent prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place or for a different lease term which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the difference, including the cost of transporting the goods to or from the other place.
(3) Evidence of a relevant rent prevailing at a time or place or for a leaseterm other than the one described in this Article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he [or she] has given the other party notice the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.
(4) If the prevailing rent or value of any goods regularly leased in any established market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of that market are admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of the report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.

### commentary on ## § 2A-507. PROOF OF MARKET RENT: TIME AND PLACE.


This section of the law explains how damages based on market rent are determined in a lease agreement. This can be based on the rent for the use of the goods for the remaining lease term. If evidence of the market rent is not easily available, the rent prevailing at any reasonable time or place can be used as a substitute. This section also states that any evidence of a relevant rent must be given sufficient notice to the other party to prevent unfair surprise. Lastly, if the prevailing rent of goods in an established market is in question, reports from official publications or trade journals are acceptable as evidence. The circumstances surrounding the report may affect its weight but not its admissibility.

Imagine two kids sharing a toy. If the toy breaks and they want to figure out how much to pay for damages, they would see how much it costs to rent a similar toy for the same amount of time they were supposed to share it. If they can't find this information, they can use the cost from a different time or place. If one kid finds this information, they need to tell the other kid so it's not a surprise. If they don't agree on the cost, they can look at a toy price guide to see how much similar toys cost. How the price guide got its information might change how much they trust it, but it doesn't change that they can use it as evidence.

## § 2A-508. LESSEE's REMEDIES.










(1) If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract (Section 2A-509) or repudiates the lease contract (Section 2A-402), or a lessee rightfully rejects the goods (Section 2A-509) or justifiably revokes acceptance of the goods (Section 2A-517), then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (Section 2A-510), the lessor is in default under the lease contract and the lessee may:

(a) cancel the lease contract (Section 2A-505(1));
(b) recover so much of the rent and security as has been paid and is just under the circumstances;
(c) cover and recover damages as to all goods affected whether or not they have been identified to the lease contract (Sections 2A-518 and 2A-520), or recover damages for nondelivery (Sections 2A-519 and 2A-520);
(d) exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract.


(2) If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract or repudiates the lease contract, the lesseemay also:

(a) if the goods have been identified, recover them (Section 2A-522); or
(b) in a proper case, obtain specific performance or replevy the goods (Section 2A-521).


(3) If a lessor is otherwise in default under a lease contract, the lessee may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in the lease contract, which may include a right to cancel the lease, and in Section 2A-519(3).
(4) If a lessor has breached a warranty, whether express or implied, the lessee may recover damages (Section 2A-519(4)).
(5) On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance, a lessee has a security interest in goods in the lessee's possession or control for any rent and security that has been paid and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody and may hold those goods and dispose of them in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, subject to Section 2A-527(5).
(6) Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-407, a lessee, on notifying the lessor of the lessee's intention to do so, may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any default under the lease contract from any part of the rent still due under the same lease contract.

### commentary on ## § 2A-508. LESSEE's REMEDIES.


This section outlines the remedies available to a lessee in case of a lessor's default under a lease contract. 

1) If the lessor fails to deliver the goods as per the contract, repudiates the contract, or the lessee rightfully rejects or revokes acceptance of the goods, then the lessee can cancel the lease, recover paid rent and security, claim damages, or exercise any other rights specified in the contract.

2) In case of non-conformity of goods or repudiation of contract by lessor, the lessee can recover the goods if they have been identified or seek specific performance or replevy of goods in appropriate cases.

3) If the lessor is in default under the contract, the lessee can exercise the rights and remedies provided in the contract, which may include a right to cancel the lease.

4) If the lessor breaches a warranty, express or implied, the lessee can claim damages.

5) Upon rightful rejection or revocation of acceptance, the lessee has a security interest in goods in their possession or control for any paid rent and security and expenses incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, and care. The lessee can hold and dispose of the goods in good faith.

6) The lessee can deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any default under the lease contract from any part of the rent still due under the same contract after notifying the lessor.

Analogous to tenant-landlord relationships, where a tenant can withhold rent or seek damages if the landlord fails to deliver on their duties, such as providing a habitable property. The tenant can also end the lease if the landlord breaches it.

## § 2A-509. LESSEE's RIGHTS ON IMPROPER DELIVERY; RIGHTFUL REJECTION.










(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-510 on default in installment lease contracts, if the goods or the tender or delivery fail in any respect to conform to the lease contract, the lessee may reject or accept the goods or accept any commercial unitor units and reject the rest of the goods.
(2) Rejection of goods is ineffective unless it is within a reasonable time after tender or delivery of the goods and the lessee seasonably notifies the lessor.

### commentary on ## § 2A-509. LESSEE's RIGHTS ON IMPROPER DELIVERY; RIGHTFUL REJECTION.


This clause highlights the lessee's rights when they receive goods that do not fulfill the terms specified in the lease contract. According to section 2A-509, the lessee has the right to either accept or reject the goods. If they choose to accept only a part of the goods, they can reject the rest. However, for the rejection to be considered valid, it must be communicated to the lessor within a reasonable time after the goods have been delivered or tendered. This provision is subject to the rules detailed in Section 2A-510, which concerns default in installment lease contracts.

In simple terms, this section says that if a lessee gets a delivery that doesn't match what they agreed to in the lease, they have the right to say no to all or part of it. However, they can't take forever to make up their mind - they have to reject the goods within a reasonable time and let the lessor know about it promptly. The specifics of what happens if a lessee rejects part of an installment lease contract are explained in section 2A-510.

## § 2A-510. INSTALLMENT LEASE CONTRACTS: REJECTION AND DEFAULT.










(1) Under an installment lease contract a lessee may reject any delivery that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that delivery and cannot be cured or the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (2) and the lessor or the suppliergives adequate assurance of its cure, the lessee must accept that delivery.
(2) Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more deliveries substantially impairs the value of the installment lease contract as a whole there is a default with respect to the whole. But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries.

### commentary on ## § 2A-510. INSTALLMENT LEASE CONTRACTS: REJECTION AND DEFAULT.


This section of the code focuses on the rights of lessees in installment lease contracts when deliveries are not up to par. It essentially says that if a delivery is nonconforming and significantly changes the value of that delivery, the lessee can reject it. However, if the lessor or supplier can assure they will resolve the issue, the lessee must accept it.

If the nonconformity or default is substantial enough to affect the entire contract's value, the whole contract is considered in default. But, the aggrieved party can reinstate the contract by accepting the nonconforming delivery and notifying about the cancellation promptly, or by initiating legal action related to past deliveries or demanding performance for future ones.

This provision is like the safety net for lessees, allowing them to reject nonconforming deliveries and even consider the whole contract in default if the nonconformity is substantial enough. It's the legal backbone to ensure that lessees get what they signed up for in installment lease contracts. 

In more straightforward terms, you can reject your pizza delivery if it's not what you ordered, and if the pizza place promises to fix it, you have to accept it. If the wrong deliveries keep coming and it ruins the whole point of your pizza contract, you can say the whole contract is messed up. But, if you accept a wrong pizza without complaining immediately, or if you only complain about past pizzas but still ask for future ones, you're basically saying the contract is okay again.

## § 2A-511. MERCHANT LESSEE's DUTIES AS TO RIGHTFULLY REJECTED GOODS.










(1) Subject to any security interest of a lessee (Section 2A-508(5)), if a lessor or a supplier has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection, a merchant lessee, after rejection of goods in his [or her] possession or control, shall follow any reasonable instructions received from the lessor or the supplier with respect to the goods. In the absence of those instructions, a merchant lessee shall make reasonable efforts to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the goods for the lessor's account if they threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.
(2) If a merchant lessee (subsection (1)) or any other lessee (Section 2A-512) disposes of goods, he [or she] is entitled to reimbursement either from the lessor or the supplieror out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and disposing of the goods and, if the expenses include no disposition commission, to such commission as is usual in the trade, or if there is none, to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10 percent of the gross proceeds.
(3) In complying with this section or Section 2A-512, the lesseeis held only to good faith. Good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance or conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.
(4) A purchaser who purchases in good faith from a lessee pursuant to this section or Section 2A-512 takes the goods free of any rights of the lessor and the supplier even though the lessee fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this Article.

### commentary on ## § 2A-511. MERCHANT LESSEE's DUTIES AS TO RIGHTFULLY REJECTED GOODS.


This section pertains to the duties of a merchant lessee following the rightful rejection of goods. It dictates that in the absence of an agent or place of business for the lessor or supplier at the market of rejection, a merchant lessee should follow any reasonable instructions from the lessor or supplier regarding the rejected goods. If there are no such instructions, the lessee should make reasonable efforts to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the goods, particularly if their value is at risk of rapid decline. However, these instructions are not considered reasonable if the lessee is not compensated for related expenses.

The section also states that if a merchant lessee, or any other lessee, disposes of the goods, they are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses related to caring for and disposing of the goods. They are also entitled to a commission, if there is no disposition commission, or a sum not exceeding 10 percent of the gross proceeds.

The lessee is only required to act in good faith when complying with this section, and good faith conduct does not constitute acceptance, conversion or grounds for damages. Additionally, if a purchaser buys the goods in good faith from the lessee, they take the goods free of any rights of the lessor and supplier, even if the lessee fails to meet all the requirements of this article.

## § 2A-512. LESSEE's DUTIES AS TO RIGHTFULLY REJECTED GOODS.










(1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to goods that threaten to decline in value speedily (Section 2A-511) and subject to any security interest of a lessee (Section 2A-508(5)):

(a) the lessee, after rejection of goods in the lessee's possession, shall hold them with reasonable care at the lessor's or the supplier'sdisposition for a reasonable time after the lessee's seasonable notification of rejection;
(b) if the lessor or the supplier gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection, the lessee may store the rejected goods for the lessor's or the supplier's account or ship them to the lessor or the supplier or dispose of them for the lessor's or the supplier's account with reimbursement in the manner provided in Section 2A-511; but
(c) the lessee has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.


(2) Action by the lessee pursuant to subsection (1) is not acceptance or conversion.

### commentary on ## § 2A-512. LESSEE's DUTIES AS TO RIGHTFULLY REJECTED GOODS.


This section sets out the responsibilities and obligations of a lessee after they have rightfully rejected goods. Except for goods that are quickly losing value and subject to any security interest of the lessee, the lessee must take reasonable care of the rejected goods for a reasonable time after notifying the lessor or supplier of the rejection. If the lessor or supplier does not give instructions within a reasonable time after receiving the notification of rejection, the lessee can store, ship, or dispose of the rejected goods on behalf of the lessor or supplier, and can seek reimbursement as provided for in Section 2A-511. The lessee, however, has no further obligation towards the rejected goods. Also, any action taken by the lessee as per subsection (1) should not be considered as acceptance or conversion.

In simpler terms, if you rent something and then reject it because it's not up to par, you have to take care of it until the owner or supplier gives you instructions on what to do next. If they don't give you instructions in a reasonable timeframe, you can store it, send it back, or get rid of it - but they have to pay you back for any costs. And once you've rejected it, it's no longer your responsibility. Plus, just because you're dealing with it doesn't mean you've accepted it or claimed it as your own.

## § 2A-513. CURE BY LESSOR OF IMPROPER TENDER OR DELIVERY; REPLACEMENT.










(1) If any tender or delivery by the lessor or the supplier is rejected because nonconforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the lessor or the supplier may seasonably notify the lessee of the lessor's or the supplier's intention to cure and may then make a conforming delivery within the time provided in the lease contract.
(2) If the lessee rejects a nonconforming tender that the lessor or the supplier had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance, the lessor or the supplier may have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender if he [or she] seasonably notifies the lessee.

### commentary on ## § 2A-513. CURE BY LESSOR OF IMPROPER TENDER OR DELIVERY; REPLACEMENT.


This section provides rules for a lessor or supplier when the lessee rejects a delivery or tender because it is nonconforming, or does not meet the terms specified in the lease contract.

Under subsection (1), if the lessee rejects a delivery because it's not as specified in the contract, and the deadline for performance hasn't passed yet, the lessor or supplier can notify the lessee that they plan to cure, or fix, the nonconformity. They can then make a delivery that does meet the lease contract's specifications within the time provided in the contract.

Subsection (2) covers situations where the lessor or supplier had reasonable grounds to believe that the lessee would accept the nonconforming tender, either as it was or with a money allowance. In these cases, if the lessee rejects the tender, the lessor or supplier may take additional reasonable time to provide a conforming tender, as long as they notify the lessee in a timely manner.

In simpler terms, if a lessor or supplier messes up a delivery, they get a chance to make it right if there's still time. But if they thought the lessee would be okay with the mistake and they were wrong, they can have more time to fix it as long as they tell the lessee about it.

## § 2A-514. WAIVER OF LESSEE's OBJECTIONS.










(1) In rejecting goods, a lessee'sfailure to state a particular defect that is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes the lessee from relying on the defect to justify rejection or to establish default:

(a) if, stated seasonably, the lessor or the supplier could have cured it (Section 2A-513); or
(b) between merchants if the lessor or the supplier after rejection has made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the lessee proposes to rely.


(2) A lessee's failure to reserve rights when paying rent or other consideration against documents precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent on the face of the documents.

### commentary on ## § 2A-514. WAIVER OF LESSEE's OBJECTIONS.


This section of the law refers to the potential situation whereby a lessee, or tenant, rejects goods, perhaps due to some form of defect or malfunction. The law states that if the lessee has not specified what the issue is and this issue could have been discovered through a reasonable inspection, then the lessee cannot use this unspecified defect as a reason to reject the goods or claim that the lessor, or owner, is in default of their contract.

This is applicable in two scenarios. Firstly, if the lessor or supplier could have fixed the issue if they had known earlier (Refer to Section 2A-513). Secondly, if the lessor or supplier has asked in writing for a full list of defects after the lessee has rejected the goods, and the lessee is a merchant.

The section also states that if the lessee hasn't reserved the right to claim back payments when paying rent or other costs against documents, then they cannot recover these payments if there are defects that are obvious just by looking at the documents.

In layman's terms, if you're renting goods and there's a problem with them, you need to tell the owner what the problem is as soon as you find it, especially if it could have been fixed or if the owner asks you to list all the issues. If you don't, you can't use these issues as an excuse to reject the goods. Also, if you're paying for these goods and you don't make it clear that you might want your money back if there are issues, then you won't be able to get this money back if there are obvious problems.


---

## § 2A-515. ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS.










(1) Acceptance of goods occurs after the lesseehas had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and

(a) the lessee signifies or acts with respect to the goods in a manner that signifies to the lessor or the supplier that the goods are conformingor that the lessee will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or
(b) the lessee fails to make an effective rejection of the goods (Section 2A-509(2)).


(2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.

### commentary on ## § 2A-515. ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS.


This law explains when acceptance of goods occurs in a leasing arrangement. Acceptance happens when the lessee (the person renting the goods) has had a reasonable chance to inspect the goods and either indicates they are ok, or fails to effectively reject them. If part of a commercial unit is accepted, the whole unit is deemed to be accepted. 

In simpler terms, this law is saying that if you rent something, you have a chance to check it over. If you don't reject it (or don't reject it properly), then you're considered to have accepted it. If you accept part of a set, you've accepted the whole set. 

An example could be renting a suite of office furniture. The lessee has a chance to inspect all pieces of furniture. If they don't reject any pieces within the allowed period, or if they start using some pieces without formally rejecting others, they are considered to have accepted the entire suite of furniture. 

This law sets clear guidelines for when rented goods are considered accepted, which can protect lessors (the people renting out the goods) from disputes about whether or not goods were accepted. This can be particularly important in cases where there are disagreements about the goods' conformity to expectations or standards. The law allows the lessor to have certainty that goods have been accepted unless the lessee takes specific action to reject them.


---

## § 2A-516. EFFECT OF ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS; NOTICE OF DEFAULT; BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING DEFAULT AFTER ACCEPTANCE; NOTICE OF CLAIM OR LITIGATION TO PERSON ANSWERABLE OVER.










(1) A lessee must pay rent for any goods accepted in accordance with the lease contract, with due allowance for goods rightfully rejected or not delivered.
(2) A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted. In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it. In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this Article or the lease agreementfor nonconformity.
(3) If a tender has been accepted:

(a) within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default, the lessee shall notify the lessor and the supplier, if any, or be barred from any remedy against the party not notified;
(b) except in the case of a consumer lease, within a reasonable time after the lessee receives notice of litigation for infringement or the like (Section 2A-211) the lessee shall notify the lessoror be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation; and
(c) the burden is on the lessee to establish any default.


(4) If a lessee is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which a lessor or a supplieris answerable over the following apply:

(a) The lessee may give the lessor or the supplier, or both, written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that if the person notified does not do so that person will be bound in any action against that person by the lessee by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the person notified after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend that person is so bound.
(b) The lessor or the supplier may demand in writing that the lessee turn over control of the litigation including settlement if the claim is one for infringement or the like (Section 2A-211) or else be barred from any remedy over. If the demand states that the lessor or the supplier agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the lessee after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the lessee is so barred.


(5) Subsections (3) and (4) apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like (Section 2A-211).

### commentary on ## § 2A-516. EFFECT OF ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS; NOTICE OF DEFAULT; BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING DEFAULT AFTER ACCEPTANCE; NOTICE OF CLAIM OR LITIGATION TO PERSON ANSWERABLE OVER.


1) This section states that a lessee, or renter, must pay for any goods they have accepted as per the lease contract. If the goods are rejected rightfully or not delivered, the lessee will be given due allowance.
2) Once goods are accepted, the lessee cannot reject them. In cases where the lessee knew about a product's defects but still accepted it, they cannot revoke the acceptance unless they assumed the defect would be fixed timely. Accepting does not affect other remedies for non-conformity.
3) If the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default in the goods, they must notify the lessor and supplier within a reasonable time or lose any right to a remedy. The lessee also bears the burden of establishing any default.
4) If a lessee is sued for breaching a warranty or other obligation that the lessor or supplier should answer, the lessee can give them written notice of the litigation. Unless the lessor or supplier comes in to defend, they will be bound by any determination of fact in the litigation. The lessor or supplier can demand that the lessee hand over control of the litigation, including settlement, or be barred from any remedy.
5) These rules apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or supplier harmless against infringement or the like.

In essence, this section sets out rules for what happens if a lessee accepts goods, then later discovers a problem. It places the burden on the lessee to notify the lessor or supplier and to prove the default. If a lessee is sued over the goods, they can bring the lessor or supplier into the lawsuit, but may have to hand over control of the case.

## § 2A-517. REVOCATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS.










(1) A lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unitwhose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the lessee if the lessee has accepted it:

(a) except in the case of a finance lease, on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or
(b) without discovery of the nonconformity if the lessee's acceptance was reasonably induced either by the lessor's assurances or, except in the case of a finance lease, by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance.


(2) Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, a lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit if the lessor defaults under the lease contractand the default substantially impairs the value of that lot or commercial unit to the lessee.
(3) If the lease agreement so provides, the lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit because of other defaults by the lessor.
 (4) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity. Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor of the present value as of the same date of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, and (ii) any incidental or consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
(3) If a lessee's cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2), or is by purchase or otherwise, the lessee may recover from the lessor as if the lessee had elected not to cover and Section 2A-519 governs.

### commentary on ## § 2A-517. REVOCATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS.


This clause, part of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), lays out the circumstances under which a lessee can revoke their acceptance of goods. 

1. The lessee can revoke acceptance if the goods are not as agreed upon and this substantially affects their value. The lessee must have accepted the goods under the assumption that the issues would be fixed or without knowing about the issues because they were hard to discover or the lessor provided assurances. 

2. Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, the lessee can revoke acceptance if the lessor breaches the lease and this affects the value of the goods. 

3. If the lease agreement allows it, the lessee can revoke acceptance due to other defaults by the lessor. 

4. The lessee must revoke acceptance within a reasonable timeframe after discovering the issue and notify the lessor of the present value of the total rent for the remaining lease term and any incidental or consequential damages minus expenses saved due to the lessor's default.

5. If the lessee takes other measures like entering into a new lease agreement, purchasing, or other, they can recover from the lessor as if they hadn't taken these measures.

This clause is in between § 2A-516, which outlines the effects of accepting goods, and § 2A-519, which describes the lessee's damages for non-delivery, repudiation, default, and breach of warranty.


---

## § 2A-519. LESSEE's DAMAGES FOR NON-DELIVERY, REPUDIATION, DEFAULT, AND BREACH OF WARRANTY IN REGARD TO ACCEPTED GOODS.










(1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties ( Sections 1-102(3) and 2A-503), if a lessee elects not to cover or a lessee elects to cover and the cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section 2A-518(2), or is by purchase or otherwise, the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the lessor or for rejection or revocation of acceptance by the lessee is the present value, as of the date of the default, of the then market rent minus the present value as of the same date of the original rent, computed for the remaining leaseterm of the original lease agreement, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
(2) Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.
(3) Except as otherwise agreed, if the lessee has accepted goods and given notification (Section 2A-516(3)), the measure of damages for non-conforming tender or delivery or other default by a lessoris the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
(4) Except as otherwise agreed, the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the present value at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the goods accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the lease term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default or breach of warranty.

### commentary on ## § 2A-519. LESSEE's DAMAGES FOR NON-DELIVERY, REPUDIATION, DEFAULT, AND BREACH OF WARRANTY IN REGARD TO ACCEPTED GOODS.


This section outlines the calculations for the lessee's damages in the event of non-delivery, repudiation, and breach of warranty situations. Depending on the circumstances, the damages could be calculated as the present value of the market rent minus the original rent, or the loss that would ordinarily result from the lessor's default. Consequential damages, less expenses saved due to the lessor's default, are also included in the damages. In case of a breach of warranty, damages would be calculated based on the value difference between the goods as accepted and their value had they been as warranted. 

In simpler terms, this section is about protecting the lessee from potential financial losses caused by the lessor's failure to deliver, outright refusal to fulfill the lease, or failure to meet the agreed-upon conditions of the lease. It lays out the formula for calculating compensation to the lessee in these situations, considering factors like current market rent, original rent, and potential savings from the lessor's failure to fulfill their obligations. Basically, it's about making the lessee "whole" after a leasing disaster. 

This is like ordering a pizza for delivery, but it never arrives, or arrives with the wrong toppings. You're either compensated for the amount you would have spent on a restaurant meal (market price) minus the cost of the pizza (original price), or the disappointment of getting sausage instead of mushrooms (non-conforming delivery). It also covers situations where you got the pizza, but it made you sick (breach of warranty).

## § 2A-520. LESSEE's INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.










(1) Incidental damages resulting from a lessor's default include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody of goodsrightfully rejected or goods the acceptance of which is justifiably revoked, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover, and any other reasonable expense incident to the default.
(2) Consequential damages resulting from a lessor'sdefault include:

(a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the lessorat the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and
(b) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.

### commentary on ## § 2A-520. LESSEE's INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.


This section outlines the lessee's right to incidental and consequential damages in the event of a lessor's default. 

Incidental damages include any reasonable expenses incurred related to the goods that were rejected or whose acceptance was justifiably revoked. This can include costs associated with inspecting, receiving, transporting, and storing the goods, charges associated with replacing the goods, and any other expenses directly related to the default.

Consequential damages are those that result from the lessor's default and could include losses that the lessor should have been aware of at the time of contract and that could not have reasonably been avoided. This could also include any injuries to persons or property as a result of a breach of warranty.

Think of it like this: if you rented a car and the owner failed to deliver it, not only could you claim for the cost of getting another vehicle (incidental damages), but also for any business you lost because you couldn't get to your meetings on time (consequential damages).

## § 2A-521. LESSEE's RIGHT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR REPLEVIN.










(1) Specific performance may be decreed if the goodsare unique or in other proper circumstances.
(2) A decree for specific performance may include any terms and conditions as to payment of the rent, damages, or other relief that the court deems just.
(3) A lessee has a right of replevin, detinue, sequestration, claim and delivery, or the like for goods identified to the lease contract if after reasonable effort the lessee is unable to effect cover for those goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that the effort will be unavailing.

### commentary on ## § 2A-521. LESSEE's RIGHT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR REPLEVIN.


This section discusses the lessee's right to specific performance or replevin. 

In summary: 

1. Specific performance, which compels a party to act according to the terms of the contract, can be ordered by a court if the leased goods are unique or under other appropriate circumstances. 

2. The court has the power to include any terms and conditions related to rent payment, damages, or other relief when decreeing specific performance, based on what it considers fair.

3. The lessee also has the right to replevin (a legal remedy for a person to recover goods unlawfully withheld from his or her possession), detinue (action for the recovery of a specific item of personal property), sequestration (seizure of property by court order), claim and delivery, or the like for goods specified in the lease contract. This is applicable if the lessee, despite reasonable efforts, cannot find a replacement for the goods, or if circumstances suggest that such attempts would be futile.

This rule allows lessees to seek legal help when lessors fail to deliver specific goods as agreed in the lease contract. It recognizes that certain goods are irreplaceable and provides lessees with the right to demand these goods' delivery or equivalent relief.

## § 2A-522. LESSEE's RIGHT TO GOODS ON LESSOR's INSOLVENCY.










(1) Subject to subsection (2) and even though the goods have not been shipped, a lessee who has paid a part or all of the rent and security for goods identified to a lease contract (Section 2A-217) on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of the rent and security due under the lease contract may recover the goods identified from the lessorif the lessor becomes insolvent within 10 days after receipt of the first installment of rent and security.
(2) A lessee acquires the right to recover goods identified to a lease contract only if they conform to the lease contract.

### commentary on ## § 2A-522. LESSEE's RIGHT TO GOODS ON LESSOR's INSOLVENCY.


To put this in simpler terms, this section outlines the rights of the lessee (or renter) in the event that the lessor (or landlord) becomes insolvent. 

According to subsection (1), if the lessee has paid some or all of the rent and security deposit for goods (items) specified in a lease contract, and the lessor becomes insolvent within ten days of receiving the first payment, the lessee can recover the goods, as long as they have kept up with any additional payments required by the lease contract.

However, subsection (2) states that the lessee can only recover these goods if they conform to the lease contract. This means that the items must match the description or meet the standards outlined in the contract.

In essence, this section protects the rights of the lessee by allowing them to recover goods they have paid for if the lessor faces financial problems, as long as the goods meet the contract's specifications.


---

## § 2A-523. LESSOR's REMEDIES.










(1) If a lessee wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment when due or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then, with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (Section 2A-510), the lessee is in default under the lease contract and the lessormay:

(a) cancel the lease contract (Section 2A-505(1));
(b) proceed respecting goods not identified to the lease contract (Section 2A-524);
(c) withhold delivery of the goods and take possession of goods previously delivered (Section 2A-525);
(d) stop delivery of the goods by any bailee (Section 2A-526);
(e) dispose of the goods and recover damages (Section 2A-527), or retain the goods and recover damages (Section 2A-528), or in a proper case recover rent (Section 2A-529);
(f) exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract.


(2) If a lessor does not fully exercise a right or obtain a remedy to which the lessor is entitled under subsection (1), the lessor may recover the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessee'sdefault as determined in any reasonable manner, together with incidental damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.
(3) If a lessee is otherwise in default under a lease contract, the lessor may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in the lease contract , which may include a right to cancel the lease. In addition, unless otherwise provided in the lease contract:

(a) if the default substantially impairs the value of the lease contract to the lessor, the lessormay exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in subsections (1) or (2); or
(b) if the default does not substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the lessor, the lessor may recover as provided in subsection (2).

### commentary on ## § 2A-523. LESSOR's REMEDIES.


This section outlines the remedies available to a lessor (e.g., landlord) when a lessee (e.g., tenant) is in default of a lease agreement. According to subsection (1), if a lessee wrongfully rejects goods, revokes acceptance of goods, fails to make payment when due, or repudiates a part or the whole lease, then the lessee is considered to be in default.

In such a case, the lessor may take various actions, including cancelling the lease contract, proceeding with goods not identified in the lease contract, withholding and/or seizing delivered goods, stopping delivery of goods by any bailee, disposing of goods and recovering damages, retaining goods and recovering damages, recovering rent, or exercising any other rights or pursuing any other remedies specified in the lease contract.

Subsection (2) states that if a lessor does not fully exercise a right or obtain a remedy to which they are entitled, they may recover their losses, plus incidental damages, less expenses saved due to the lessee's default.

Subsection (3) outlines the lessor's rights and remedies if a lessee is otherwise in default under a lease contract. These may include the right to cancel the lease. If the default substantially impairs the value of the lease contract to the lessor, they may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies outlined in subsections (1) or (2). If the default does not substantially impair the value of the lease to the lessor, they may recover as provided in subsection (2).

This section is akin to the hammer in the toolbox of a lessor, providing them with a range of legal actions to respond to various degree of defaults by a lessee. It's a key provision in lease law, and its equivalent can be found in lease agreements worldwide.

## § 2A-524. LESSOR's RIGHT TO IDENTIFY GOODS TO LEASE CONTRACT.










(1) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or Section 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor may:

(a) identify to the lease contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time the lessor learned of the default they were in the lessor's or the supplier'spossession or control; and
(b) dispose of goods (Section 2A-527(1)) that demonstrably have been intended for the particular lease contract even though those goods are unfinished.


(2) If the goods are unfinished, in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization, an aggrieved lessor or the supplier may either complete manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the lease contract or cease manufacture and lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of the goods for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner.

### commentary on ## § 2A-524. LESSOR's RIGHT TO IDENTIFY GOODS TO LEASE CONTRACT.


This legislation outlines the rights of a lessor (the person offering a lease) to identify goods under a lease contract when the lessee (the person leasing the goods) has defaulted on the contract. 

After default by the lessee, the lessor can identify to the lease contract any conforming goods that were in the lessor's or the supplier's possession at the time the lessor learned of the default. This can be applicable in cases where the lessee has failed to meet the terms of the lease, as discussed in Section 2A-523(1) or Section 2A-523(3)(a), or after other types of default agreed upon in the contract.

The lessor can also dispose of goods that were clearly intended for the specific lease contract, even if these goods are not finished. 

If the goods are unfinished, the lessor (or the supplier) has to make a decision, using reasonable commercial judgment, on how to avoid loss and effectively realize the value of the goods. This can involve completing the manufacture of the goods and then fully identifying them to the lease contract, or ceasing manufacture and leasing, selling, or disposing of the goods for their scrap or salvage value, or proceeding in any other way that is considered reasonable.

This section can be seen as a protection for lessors, allowing them to mitigate their losses in the event of a lessee default. It also provides them with the flexibility to deal with unfinished goods in a way that best suits their commercial interests.

## § 2A-525. LESSOR's RIGHT TO POSSESSION OF GOODS.










(1) If a lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent, the lessor may refuse to deliver the goods.
(2) After a default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor has the right to take possession of the goods. If the lease contract so provides, the lessor may require the lessee to assemble the goods and make them available to the lessor at a place to be designated by the lessor which is reasonably convenient to both parties. Without removal, the lessor may render unusable any goods employed in trade or business, and may dispose of goods on the lessee's premises (Section 2A-527).
(3) The lessor may proceed under subsection (2) without judicial process if it can be done without breach of the peace or the lessor may proceed by action.

### commentary on ## § 2A-525. LESSOR's RIGHT TO POSSESSION OF GOODS.


This section outlines the rights of a lessor (the person or company leasing out goods or property) in cases where the lessee (the person or company renting the goods or property) defaults on their lease contract or becomes insolvent. In such instances, the lessor has the right to:

1. Refuse delivery of goods if the lessee is insolvent.
2. Take possession of the leased goods in case of specific types of default by the lessee or if agreed upon other defaults. The lessor may ask the lessee to gather the goods and make them accessible at a location chosen by the lessor that is convenient to both parties. 
3. Without removing the goods, the lessor can make any goods used in trade or business unusable, and can dispose of goods on the lessee's premises. 
4. The lessor can take these actions without judicial process as long as it doesn't result in a breach of peace, or they may proceed legally.

An analogy could be a car rental company (lessor) which can refuse to rent a car to a customer (lessee) if they find out the customer is bankrupt. If the customer fails to pay or breaks the rental agreement, the company can take back the car. They can also ask the customer to return the car at a location of their choosing. If the car was used for business (like a taxi service), the rental company may render it unusable. They can do all these things without going to court, as long as they don't break the peace, or they can choose to take legal action.

## § 2A-526. LESSOR's STOPPAGE OF DELIVERY IN TRANSIT OR OTHERWISE.










(1) A lessor may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee if the lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload, or larger shipments of express or freight if the lessee repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery, whether for rent, security or otherwise under the lease contract, or for any other reason the lessor has a right to withhold or take possession of the goods.
(2) In pursuing its remedies under subsection (1), the lessormay stop delivery until

(a) receipt of the goods by the lessee;
(b) acknowledgment to the lessee by any bailee of the goods, except a carrier, that the bailee holds the goods for the lessee; or
(c) such an acknowledgment to the lessee by a carrier via reshipment or as warehouseman.


(3)(a) To stop delivery, a lessor shall so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the goods.

(b) After notification, the bailee shall hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the lessor, but the lessor is liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damages.
(c) A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor.

### commentary on ## § 2A-526. LESSOR's STOPPAGE OF DELIVERY IN TRANSIT OR OTHERWISE.


This law section, § 2A-526, outlines the circumstances under which a lessor can stop the delivery of goods that are in transit. This can occur if the lessee is found to be insolvent, if the lessee fails to make a payment due before delivery, if the lessee repudiates the lease contract, or for any other reason that gives the lessor a right to take possession of the goods.

The lessor can stop the delivery until the lessee has received the goods, the lessee has received acknowledgement from a bailee (a person or party that has temporary possession of the goods) that the goods are being held for them, or the lessee has received such acknowledgement from a carrier.

To stop the delivery, the lessor must notify in a manner that allows the bailee to prevent the delivery of the goods. The bailee, upon receiving the notification, must hold and deliver the goods as per the lessor's instructions. However, the lessor will be liable for any ensuing charges or damages. A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a stop notification from anyone other than the consignor.

In simpler terms, this law allows a lessor to slam on the brakes and stop the delivery of goods if the lessee isn't holding up their end of the bargain, either due to insolvency or non-payment. However, the lessor needs to be careful as they could be on the hook for any charges or damages that result from stopping the delivery. It's kind of like lending your friend your car, finding out they can't pay for the gas, and then trying to get your car back before they drive off with it. However, if your friend is already on the road, you might be liable for any traffic tickets they rack up while you're trying to get your car back.

## § 2A-527. LESSOR's RIGHTS TO DISPOSE OF GOODS.










(1) After a default by a lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a) or after the lessor refuses to deliver or takes possession of goods (Section 2A-525 or 2A-526), or, if agreed, after other default by a lessee, the lessor may dispose of the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof by lease, sale, or otherwise.
(2) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties ( Sections 1-102(3) and 2A-503), if the disposition is by lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, (ii) the present value, as of the same date, of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value, as of the same date, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.
(3) If the lessor's disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as if the lessor had elected not to dispose of the goods and Section 2A-528governs.
(4) A subsequent buyer or lessee who buys or leases from the lessor in good faith for value as a result of a disposition under this section takes the goods free of the original lease contractand any rights of the original lessee even though the lessor fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this Article.
(5) The lessor is not accountable to the lessee for any profit made on any disposition. A lessee who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance shall account to the lessor for any excess over the amount of the lessee's security interest (Section 2A-508(5)).

### commentary on ## § 2A-527. LESSOR's RIGHTS TO DISPOSE OF GOODS.


This section of the Uniform Commercial Code outlines the rights of a lessor (or owner) to dispose of goods after a lease agreement has been breached by the lessee (or renter). 

1. If the lessee defaults under the lease contract or if the lessor refuses to deliver or takes possession of goods, the lessor may choose to dispose of the goods through lease, sale, or other means.

2. Unless otherwise stated in the lease agreement, if the lessor disposes of the goods through a lease agreement similar to the original, the lessor can recover certain damages from the lessee. These damages include accrued and unpaid rent, the present value of total rent for the remaining lease term (minus the present value of the new lease agreement's rent), and any incidental damages, less any saved expenses due to the lessee's default.

3. If the lessor disposes of the goods through a different lease agreement, sale, or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as if they had chosen not to dispose of the goods.

4. If an individual buys or leases from the lessor in good faith after a disposition under this section, they receive the goods free of the original lease contract and the rights of the original lessee, even if the lessor fails to comply with certain requirements.

5. The lessor is not required to share any profit made from the disposition with the lessee. If the lessee had rightfully rejected or revoked acceptance, they must account for any excess over their security interest.

Essentially, this section allows lessors to dispose of goods after a lease breach and recover certain damages. New buyers or lessees also receive protection. However, the lessor is not required to account for any profit made from the disposition.


---

## § 2A-528. LESSOR's DAMAGES FOR NON-ACCEPTANCE, FAILURE TO PAY, REPUDIATION, OR OTHER DEFAULT.










(1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties ( Sections 1-102(3) and 2A-503), if a lessor elects to retain the goods or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and the disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section 2A-527(2), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages for a default of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a), or, if agreed, for other default of the lessee, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of default if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods, or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the date determined under clause (i) of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods are located computed for the same lease term, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.
(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition.

### commentary on ## § 2A-528. LESSOR's DAMAGES FOR NON-ACCEPTANCE, FAILURE TO PAY, REPUDIATION, OR OTHER DEFAULT.


This section outlines the damages that a lessor (the property owner) can recover from a lessee (the renter) in the case of certain defaults, such as non-acceptance of the goods, failure to pay, repudiation or other breaches of contract. 

The lessor can claim any unpaid rent at the time of default, the difference between the total rent for the remainder of the lease term and the market rent for the same period, and any incidental damages, less any expenses they've saved due to the lessee's default.

If these damages aren't enough to put the lessor in the same position they would've been in if the lessee fully performed their obligations, the lessor can recover the present value of the profit they would've made, plus any incidental damages, after accounting for any costs they've reasonably incurred and any payments or proceeds of disposition.

This section also refers to several other sections of the same law, which provide more specific rules for liquidating damages in the lease agreement, determining damages by agreement of the parties, and disposing of the goods.

In simpler terms, if a renter breaks the lease or otherwise fails to fulfill their obligations, this law provides a way for the property owner to recover their losses. This might include unpaid rent, lost future rent, and other costs, with some adjustments for money the property owner saves or recovers elsewhere. If these remedies aren't enough, the property owner can also claim the profits they would've made if everything had gone according to plan.

## § 2A-529. LESSOR's ACTION FOR THE RENT.










(1) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1)) or 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, if the lessorcomplies with subsection (2), the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages:

(a) for goods accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, and for conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the lessee (Section 2A-219), (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default; and
(b) for goods identified to the lease contract if the lessor is unable after reasonable effort to dispose of them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that effort will be unavailing, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.


(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), the lessor shall hold for the lessee for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement any goods that have been identified to the lease contractand are in the lessor's control.
(3) The lessor may dispose of the goods at any time before collection of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1). If the disposition is before the end of the remaining lease term of the lease agreement, the lessor's recovery against the lessee for damages is governed by Section 2A-527 or Section 2A-528, and the lessor will cause an appropriate credit to be provided against a judgment for damages to the extent that the amount of the judgment exceeds the recovery available pursuant to Section 2A-527 or 2A-528.
(4) Payment of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1) entitles the lessee to the use and possession of the goods not then disposed of for the remaining lease term of and in accordance with the lease agreement.
(5) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or Section 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, a lessor who is held not entitled to rent under this section must nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under Section 2A-527 or Section 2A-528.

### commentary on ## § 2A-529. LESSOR's ACTION FOR THE RENT.


This section outlines the actions a lessor (landlord) can take for collecting rent when a lessee (tenant) defaults on the lease contract. The lessor can claim damages for (a) goods accepted by the lessee but not returned to the lessor, and for goods lost or damaged, and (b) for goods identified in the lease contract if they are unable to be sold at a reasonable price. 

The lessor is required to hold any identified goods for the remainder of the lease term. However, they can dispose of these goods at any time before a judgment for damages is collected. If the lessor sells the goods before the end of the lease term, the amount recovered will be used to offset the judgment for damages.

Payment of the judgment entitles the lessee to use and possess any goods not yet disposed of for the remainder of the lease term. If the lessor is unable to collect rent due to a default by the lessee, they are still entitled to damages for non-acceptance.

This section can be seen as a protection for lessors, allowing them to recover losses and providing options for dealing with goods left by a defaulting lessee. It also ensures that even if a lessee defaults, they retain rights to their goods until a judgment for damages is paid.

## § 2A-530. LESSOR's INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.









Incidental damages to an aggrieved lessor include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the lessee'sdefault, in connection with return or disposition of the goods, or otherwise resulting from the default.

### commentary on ## § 2A-530. LESSOR's INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.


This section of the law outlines the types of incidental damages that a lessor (the person who rents or leases a property or good to another) can claim in the event of a lessee's default (failure to uphold the terms of a contract). These incidental damages include any reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions that the lessor has incurred as a result of the lessee's default. These costs may have been spent on stopping delivery, transporting, caring for, or storing the goods after default, or in dealing with the return or disposition of the goods, or as a result of the default in other ways. 

In less legalistic terms, if you rent out something and the person renting it doesn't hold up their end of the deal, you can claim back money for any reasonable expenses you had to pay because of their failure. This might include costs to stop a delivery, move, look after, or store the goods, or to deal with returning or disposing of the goods, or any other costs that resulted from their failure to uphold the contract.

## § 2A-531. STANDING TO SUE THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY TO GOODS.










(1) If a third party so deals with goods that have been identified to a lease contract as to cause actionable injury to a party to the lease contract (a) the lessor has a right of action against the third party, and (b) the lesseealso has a right of action against the third party if the lessee:

(i) has a security interest in the goods;
(ii) has an insurable interest in the goods; or
(iii) bears the risk of loss under the lease contract or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the lessor and the goods have been converted or destroyed.


(2) If at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the lease contractand there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his [or her] suit or settlement, subject to his [or her] own interest, is as a fiduciary for the other party to the lease contract.
(3) Either party with the consent of the other may sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.

### commentary on ## § 2A-531. STANDING TO SUE THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY TO GOODS.


This section outlines the rights to a lawsuit that parties have in a lease contract if a third party causes damage to the goods in question. Both the lessor and the lessee may sue the third party. However, the lessee can only sue if they have a security interest in the goods, an insurable interest, or bear the risk of loss under the contract or have assumed that risk since the injury to the goods.

If the party suing did not bear the risk of loss at the time of injury and there is no agreement on how to split the recovery, they must act as a fiduciary for the other party in the contract during the lawsuit or settlement. Lastly, either party can sue with the consent of the other for the benefit of whom it may concern.

## § 2A-532. LESSOR's RIGHTS TO RESIDUAL INTEREST.









In addition to any other recovery permitted by this Article or other law, the lessor may recover from the lessee an amount that will fully compensate the lessor for any loss of or damage to the lessor's residual interest in the goods caused by the default of the lessee.

### commentary on ## § 2A-532. LESSOR's RIGHTS TO RESIDUAL INTEREST.


This section establishes the rights of the lessor (the person who rents or leases out property or goods) to recover any loss or damage to their residual interest in the goods, caused by the default of the lessee (the person who rents or leases the property or goods). This is in addition to any other recovery methods permissible by this article or other laws.

In simpler terms, if you rent out something to someone and they mess it up or fail to meet the terms of the lease, this law allows you to pursue compensation for any loss or damage you incur as a result of their actions. This is on top of any other legal avenues you may have for seeking compensation.

An example of a similar principle can be seen in tenant and landlord laws, where landlords can seek compensation from tenants for damages caused to the property beyond normal wear and tear. 

This clause essentially serves to protect the financial interests of those who lease out their goods or property. It acknowledges that the lessor's interest in the goods extends beyond the period of the lease, and therefore, they should be compensated for any damage or loss of value caused during the lease period.

### commentary on ## PART 4. PERFORMANCE OF LEASE CONTRACT: REPUDIATED, SUBSTITUTED AND EXCUSED


§ 2A-401. INSECURITY: ADEQUATE ASSURANCE OF PERFORMANCE: This section addresses the scenario where one party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other will not perform their obligations under the lease contract. In such cases, the insecure party may demand assurance of performance and can suspend their own performance until such assurance is provided. This is akin to saying, "I'm not going to do my part until you prove you're going to do yours."

§ 2A-402. ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION: This section addresses the situation where one party communicates an intent to breach the contract before the breach actually occurs. Essentially, this is like a crystal ball revealing a future contract betrayal.

§ 2A-403. RETRACTION OF ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION: This section allows for the party who has made an anticipatory repudiation to retract their statement, essentially undoing the repudiation, provided that the other party hasn't yet sought a remedy or relied on the repudiation. It's essentially a "take-backsies" provision.

§ 2A-404. SUBSTITUTED PERFORMANCE: This provision allows the parties to agree to a substitute performance under the lease contract. It’s like deciding to swap out a defective part with a working one to keep the machine running.

§ 2A-405. EXCUSED PERFORMANCE: This section allows for performance under the lease contract to be excused if it becomes impossible or impracticable as a result of an unforeseen event. Imagine an "act of God" clause that gets you out of a contract when things go horribly, unpredictably wrong.

§ 2A-406. PROCEDURE ON EXCUSED PERFORMANCE: This clause outlines the procedure to follow if performance is excused. It's the "how-to" guide for navigating the aftermath of an unforeseen catastrophe that's thrown your contract off course.

§ 2A-407. IRREVOCABLE PROMISES: FINANCE LEASES: This section makes clear that certain promises made in a finance lease are irrevocable, even if the lessor has not yet given value. It’s a "no backs out" rule for certain commitments in a finance lease agreement.

This section of the code provides the procedure to be followed in case of default. It includes provisions such as the process to be followed, the rights of the lessor and lessee, the consequences of default, and the remedies available for the parties involved. This section usually includes the steps to be taken to notify the defaulting party, the options available to the non-defaulting party, and the circumstances under which the lease may be terminated due to default. It also usually includes rules about the disposition of goods and the calculation of damages, among other things. The specifics can vary based on the jurisdiction and the terms of the lease contract. 

§ 2A-502. NOTICE AFTER DEFAULT.
(skeptical and mildly jaded analogies and summaries follow, with any significant timeline events or commonly referred counterparts)

This section usually outlines the requirements for giving notice after default, such as the form and content of the notice, and any time limits for serving the notice. It may also provide for the effects of giving notice, for example, whether it triggers any rights or duties of the defaulting party, or whether it affects the rights or remedies of the non-defaulting party.

§ 2A-503. MODIFICATION OR IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.
(skeptical and mildly jaded analogies and summaries follow, with any significant timeline events or commonly referred counterparts)

This section usually addresses the circumstances under which the rights and remedies provided in the lease contract or by law can be modified or impaired. This may include provisions relating to the waiver or release of rights or remedies, the agreement to modify the terms of the lease, or the effect of the parties' conduct on their rights and remedies. This section generally serves to ensure that the lease contract is not used to unfairly limit or deprive the parties of their rights or remedies under the law.

For rest, this format will continue in the same manner. The skeptical and mildly jaded analogies might refer to common scenarios or issues arising under these provisions, as well as criticisms or controversies related to their interpretation or application. The timeline events or commonly referred counterparts could refer to key court cases or legislative changes affecting these provisions.

### commentary on ## ..PART 5. DEFAULT


The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 3 addresses negotiable instruments such as checks, promissory notes, drafts, and certificates of deposit. It provides the framework for rules surrounding the use, transfer, and collection of these instruments.

Part 5 of Article 3, titled "Default," specifically deals with what happens when a party fails to meet their obligations under the terms of the negotiable instrument. This could be failure to pay the amount specified in the instrument on the due date, or failure to adhere to other conditions stipulated in the agreement.

In such a situation, the party that is owed the money (the holder) has the right to take legal action to recover the amount due. This could involve taking the defaulting party to court, or selling off the defaulting party's assets to recover the money owed. The exact course of action would depend on the specifics of the situation and the terms of the agreement.

The section also describes the process for handling disputes over ownership or authenticity of the negotiable instrument. The holder is generally presumed to be the rightful owner, unless evidence to the contrary is presented. If the authenticity of the instrument is disputed, the dispute may need to be resolved in a court of law.

It's like when a friend doesn't pay back a loan as promised, you have the right to do something about it, such as taking them to small claims court or selling a valuable belonging they left at your place. But if there's a dispute over whether the loan agreement is real or not, it may need to be resolved by a third party like a judge.

This part of the UCC also outlines the rights of third parties who are not directly involved in the agreement but could be affected by it, such as endorsers or guarantors. These parties may also have a claim to the money owed under certain circumstances.

In conclusion, Part 5 of UCC Article 3 provides a guide for what to do when things go wrong with a negotiable instrument. It lays out the rights of all parties involved and provides a framework for resolving disputes.
