This section outlines the process for appointing governors and executive directors for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The President must appoint these officials with the advice and consent of the Senate. The governors serve five-year terms and the executive directors serve two-year terms, but they can remain in office until their successors are appointed. Alternates are also appointed with the same terms as their corresponding officials. 

If Schedule D of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund applies, the Governor of the Fund will also serve as councillor and may designate alternates and associates. 

No person serving as a governor, executive director, councillor, alternate, or associate is entitled to receive compensation from the United States. The United States executive director of the Fund and their alternate are subject to specific compensation limits. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with presenting proposals to ensure that Fund employee salaries do not exceed those in similar positions in national government service or private industry. 

Overall, this section lays out the process for appointments and compensation for key officials in the IMF and World Bank. There have been updates to compensation limits in the past, with specific limits in place for the United States executive director and alternate.

The National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems was established in 1945 to coordinate the policies and operations of the United States representatives on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The Council is composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration (if it exists).

The Council's duties include recommending general policy directives for the United States representatives on the IMF and the World Bank, advising and consulting with the President and the representatives on major problems arising in the administration of the institutions, coordinating the policies and operations of all agencies of the Government that make or participate in making foreign loans or engage in foreign financial, exchange or monetary transactions, and making reports and recommendations to the President as necessary.

The Council also has decision-making power regarding certain actions required by the Articles of Agreement of the IMF and the World Bank, including the approval, consent, or agreement of the United States. Additionally, the Council must consider the effect of development assistance loans on individual industry sectors and international commodity markets to minimize adverse impacts and avoid government subsidization without regard to economic conditions in the markets for such commodities.

Representatives of the United States on the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the Export-Import Bank of the United States and other agencies of the Government involved in foreign financial activities, must keep the Council fully informed of their activities and provide any necessary information for the Council's responsibilities.

Over the years, changes have been made to the Council's composition and responsibilities, including the removal of the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration and the addition of considerations for commodity markets.

This law, 22 U.S. Code § 286b–1, 286b–2, has been repealed since 1989 by Pub. L. 101–240. It seems to be an unremarkable law that had no significant impact on American society or international relations. It is now just a footnote in legal history, like a forgotten penny in the couch cushions. Its existence was akin to a nonchalant tree falling in the forest - it made no impact and no one heard it.

In simpler terms, this law was like a small fish in a big pond that got swallowed up by bigger and more important issues. It was as if it was a discarded piece of paper in a trash can, forgotten and irrelevant. Its repeal was like closing a book that no one bothered to read.

Unless Congress by law authorizes such action, no governor or alternate appointed to represent the United States shall vote for an increase of capital stock of the Bank under article II, section 2, of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, if such increase involves an increased subscription on the part of the United States. Neither the President nor any person or agency shall, on behalf of the United States, consent to any borrowing (other than borrowing from a foreign government or other official public source) by the Fund of funds denominated in United States dollars, unless the Secretary of the Treasury transmits a notice of such proposed borrowing to both Houses of the Congress at least 60 days prior to the date on which such borrowing is scheduled to occur.

This law requires that Congress must authorize certain actions taken on behalf of the United States, such as changing the quota of the US under the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or proposing a par value for the US dollar. The law also prohibits the US from making loans to the IMF or disposing of its gold without congressional approval. Governors or alternates representing the US are also prohibited from voting for an increase in capital stock of the World Bank if it involves an increased subscription from the US. The law was first enacted in 1945 and has been amended several times since then.

Any Federal Reserve bank which is requested to do so by the Fund or the Bank shall act as its depository or as its fiscal agent, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall supervise and direct the carrying out of these functions by the Federal Reserve banks.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 6, 59 Stat. 514.)



This law gives the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank the ability to use Federal Reserve banks as their depository or fiscal agent. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is responsible for overseeing and directing these functions. This law was passed in 1945 and has been used by the IMF and World Bank since then. It's kind of like the IMF and World Bank have a VIP bank account at the Federal Reserve, and the Board of Governors makes sure everything runs smoothly.

- Special Drawing Rights are a type of currency used by the IMF.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 30, as added Pub. L. 95–435, § 4, Oct. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 1052; amended Pub. L. 96–389, § 2(b), Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1553; Pub. L. 101–240, title V, § 541(d)(1), (f)(2), Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2518, 2519.)



This code establishes a requirement for the Secretary of the Treasury to work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to encourage the creation of stabilization programs that promote productive investment and employment, especially in areas that address basic human needs. The code was added in 1978 and has been amended several times, including in 1980 and 1989. It reflects a commitment to promoting economic stability and development, particularly in areas that are struggling or in need of investment.

Tab Content: 



The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the Executive Director of the United States to the International Monetary Fund to work in opposition to any extension of financial or technical assistance by the Supplemental Financing Facility or by any other agency or facility of such Fund to any country the government of which—
(1)
 permits entry into the territory of such country to any person who has committed an act of international terrorism, including any act of aircraft hijacking, or otherwise supports, encourages, or harbors such person; or

(2)
 fails to take appropriate measures to prevent any such person from committing any such act outside the territory of such country.

(Pub. L. 95–435, § 6, Oct. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 1053.)



This law states that the US government will instruct the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deny financial or technical assistance to any country that harbors or supports individuals who have committed acts of international terrorism or fails to take appropriate measures to prevent such acts. This law was passed in 1978 as part of efforts to combat terrorism, and it aims to use economic pressure to deter countries from supporting terrorism. Over the years, there have been debates about the effectiveness of this approach, and some critics argue that it may have unintended consequences, such as hurting innocent civilians or pushing countries into the arms of other powers. Nonetheless, this law remains on the books and continues to guide US policy towards countries that are deemed to be harboring international terrorists.

(a) Contribution authorized
(1) In general

Subject to paragraph (2), the United States Governor of the Fund may contribute $150,000,000 to the Interest Subsidy Account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the Fund on behalf of the United States.


(2) Condition

The United States Governor of the Fund may not make a commitment to contribute any amount authorized to be contributed under paragraph (1) before an amount equal to such amount has been appropriated for such purpose.



(b) Limitation on authorization of appropriations

To pay for the contribution authorized by subsection (a), there are authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $150,000,000, without fiscal year limitation, for payment by the Secretary of the Treasury.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 54, as added Pub. L. 101–240, title III, § 301, Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2500.)



This law authorizes the United States to contribute $150 million to the International Monetary Fund's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility's Interest Subsidy Account. However, this contribution can only be made if the same amount has been appropriated for the purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to make the payment, but the appropriation cannot exceed $150 million. This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1989. It is similar to a person asking their friend for money, but only if they have the same amount available to give in return.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 58, as added Pub. L. 102–511, title X, § 1001, Oct. 24, 1992, 106 Stat. 3357.)



This law allows the US Treasury Secretary to agree to sell up to 3 million ounces of gold from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to fund loans for countries that have previously owed money to the organization. This provision was added in 1992 and has not been used extensively since then. It is a complex process that involves input from multiple stakeholders, including the US Executive Director of the Fund and lenders to the Loan Account of the Trust. The IMF is a global organization dedicated to promoting international monetary cooperation and financial stability. It was created in 1945 and is composed of 190 member countries.

(d) “Person” defined

The term “person” as used in this section means an individual, partnership, corporation or association.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 8, 59 Stat. 515.)



This section of the U.S. legal code outlines the procedures for obtaining and furnishing information to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as requested by the United States. The President may require any person to furnish information deemed essential to comply with the IMF's request, and failure to do so may result in a subpoena.

When either the Fund or the Bank is a defendant in any such action, it may, at any time before the trial thereof, remove such action from a State court into the district court of the United States for the proper district by following the procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 10, 59 Stat. 516.)



This law outlines the jurisdiction and venue for legal actions involving the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank within the United States or its territories. The IMF or World Bank is considered a resident of the federal judicial district where its main office in the US is located, and any legal action involving them is deemed to be under US law. The US district courts have original jurisdiction over any such cases. If the IMF or World Bank is a defendant, they can move the case from a state court to a federal district court before the trial. This law was enacted in 1945 and has been used in various legal cases involving the IMF or World Bank.

(a) Official interpretation of authority of Fund

The governor and executive director of the Fund appointed by the United States are directed to obtain promptly an official interpretation by the Fund as to whether its authority to use its resources extends beyond current monetary stabilization operations to afford temporary assistance to members in connection with seasonal, cyclical, and emergency fluctuations in the balance of payment of any member for current transactions, and whether it has authority to use its resources to provide facilities for relief, reconstruction, or armaments, or to meet a large or sustained outflow of capital on the part of any member.


(b) Proposal of amendment

If the interpretation by the Fund answers in the affirmative any of the questions stated in subsection (a), the governor of the Fund representing the United States is directed to propose promptly and support an amendment to the Articles of Agreement for the purpose of expressly negativing such interpretation. The President is authorized and directed to accept an amendment to that effect on behalf of the United States.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 13, 59 Stat. 517.)



This code deals with the use of resources by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and directs the governor and executive director of the Fund appointed by the United States to seek an official interpretation from the Fund about the scope of its authority to use its resources. The code specifically asks whether the IMF has the authority to provide temporary assistance to its members in connection with seasonal, cyclical, and emergency fluctuations in the balance of payment. It also asks whether the IMF can use its resources to provide facilities for relief, reconstruction, or armaments, or to meet a large or sustained outflow of capital on the part of any member. If the answer to any of these questions is affirmative, this code directs the governor of the Fund representing the United States to propose an amendment to the Articles of Agreement to negate such interpretation.

In the realization that additional measures of international economic cooperation are necessary to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and render most effective the operations of the Fund and the Bank, it is declared to be the policy of the United States to seek to bring about further agreement and cooperation among nations and international bodies, as soon as possible, on ways and means which will best reduce obstacles to and restrictions upon international trade, eliminate unfair trade practices, promote mutually advantageous commercial relations, and otherwise facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and promote the stability of international economic relations. In considering the policies of the United States in foreign lending and the policies of the Fund and the Bank, particularly in conducting exchange transactions, the Council and the United States representatives on the Fund and the Bank shall give careful consideration to the progress which has been made in achieving such agreement and cooperation.


(b) Transmittal of information to Congressional committees

The President shall, upon the request of any committee of the Congress with legislative or oversight jurisdiction over monetary policy or the International Monetary Fund, provide to such committee any appropriate information relevant to that committee’s jurisdiction which is furnished to any department or agency of the United States by the International Monetary Fund. The President shall comply with this provision consistent with United States membership obligations in the International Monetary Fund and subject to such limitations as are appropriate to the sensitive nature of the information.

(Pub. L. 90–349, § 2, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 188.)



This code authorizes the President to accept an amendment to the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund, which establishes a facility based on Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and modifies certain rules and practices of the Fund. The SDR is a form of international currency created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the existing official reserves of member countries. Essentially, it's like a global "reserve currency" that can be used for international transactions and is based on a basket of major currencies. This code was enacted in 1968, around the time when the Bretton Woods system (which tied the value of the US dollar to gold) was starting to show cracks, and SDRs were seen as a potential solution to the mismatch between the growing global economy and the limited supply of gold. Today, SDRs are still used as a unit of account by the IMF, but their role in the global financial system is somewhat limited.

These certificates can only be used to finance the acquisition of SDRs or exchange stabilization operations. The amount of certificates issued cannot exceed the value of the SDRs held. The certificates are redeemed from the resources of the Exchange Stabilization Fund at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. This law was enacted in 1968.

 Neither the President nor any person or agency shall on behalf of the United States vote to allocate Special Drawing Rights under article XVIII, sections 2 and 3, of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund without consultations by the Secretary of the Treasury at least 90 days prior to any such vote, with the Chairman and ranking minority members of the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the appropriate subcommittees thereof.

(2)
 Such consultations shall include an explanation of the consistency of such proposal to allocate with the requirements of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, in particular the requirement that in all its decisions with respect to allocation of Special Drawing Rights, the Fund shall “seek to meet the long-term global need, as and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will avoid economic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand and inflation in the world”.

This law places limits on the amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) that can be allocated to the United States under the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) without authorization from Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury must also consult with certain congressional committees before any such allocation is made. This law was first enacted in 1968 and has been amended several times since then.

The President shall instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and other appropriate Federal officials to use all appropriate means to encourage countries, in formulating economic adjustment programs to deal with their balance of payments difficulties, to design those programs so as to safeguard, to the maximum feasible extent, jobs, investment, real per capita income, policies to reduce the gap in wealth between rich and poor, and social programs such as health, housing, and education.


(b) Changes in Fund guidelines, policies, and decisions; review prior to approval of standby arrangements; coordination among institutions; coordination between Fund and Bank; periodic analysesTo ensure the effectiveness of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources and the reinforcement of those programs by longer term efforts to promote sustained growth and improved living conditions—
(1) United States representatives to the Fund shall recommend and shall work for changes in Fund guidelines, policies, and decisions that would—
(A)
 permit stand-by arrangements to be extended beyond three years, as necessary to enable Fund members to implement their economic adjustment programs successfully;

(B)
 provide that in approving any economic adjustment program the Fund shall take into account the effect such program will have on jobs, investment, real per capita income, the gap in wealth between the rich and poor, and social programs such as health, housing, and education, in order to seek to minimize the adverse impact of those adjustment programs on basic human needs; and

(C)
 provide that letters of intent submitted to the Fund in support of an economic adjustment program reflect that the member country has taken into account the effect such program will have on the factors listed in subparagraph (B);


(2)
(A) before voting on the approval of any standby arrangement with respect to any economic adjustment program, the United States Executive Director shall review—
(i)
 any analysis of factors prepared by the Fund or the member country in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1), or

(ii)
 if no such analysis is prepared and available for such review, an analysis which shall be prepared by the United States Governor of the Fund which examines the effect of the program on the factors listed in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1); and


(B)
 the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall take into account the analysis reviewed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in voting on approval of that standby arrangement;


(3)
 United States representatives to the Fund, to the Bank, and to other appropriate institutions shall work toward improving coordination among these institutions and, in particular, shall work toward formulation of programs in association with economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources which (A) will, among other things, promote employment, investment, real income per capita, improvements in income distribution, and the objectives of social programs such as health, housing, and education, and (B) will, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the borrowing country’s need to improve its balance of payments position within a reasonable period, ameliorate any adverse effects of economic adjustment programs on the poor;

(4) United States representatives to the Fund and the Bank shall seek amendments to decisions on policies on the use of Fund and Bank resources to provide that, where countries are seeking Extended Fund Facility or upper credit tranche drawings from the Fund and are eligible to receive financing from the Bank, the Fund and Bank will coordinate their financing activities in order—
(A)
 to take into account the effects of economic adjustment programs on the areas listed in clause (A) of paragraph (3),

(B)
 to provide, to the extent feasible, Bank project loans designed to safeguard and further basic human needs in countries adopting economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources, and

(C)
 to provide, as appropriate, Bank financing for programs of structural adjustment that will facilitate development of a productive economic base and greater attainment of basic human needs objectives over the longer term; and


(5)
 United States representatives to the Fund and the Bank shall request the Fund and the Bank to provide periodic analyses of the effects of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund or Bank financing on jobs, investment, real income per capita, income distribution, and social programs such as health, housing, and education.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 33, as added Pub. L. 96–389, § 2(a), Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1551; amended Pub. L. 101–240, title V, § 541(d)(1), Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2518.)



This law, known as the Consideration of Basic Human Needs in Economic Adjustment Programs Supported by Fund, was added to the United States Code in 1980. It requires the President to instruct federal officials to encourage countries to design economic adjustment programs that prioritize jobs, investment, real per capita income, policies to reduce income inequality, and social programs such as health, housing, and education. 

The law also requires United States representatives to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to work towards changes in IMF guidelines, policies, and decisions that take into account the impact of economic adjustment programs on basic human needs. Before approving any standby arrangements with respect to any economic adjustment program, the US Executive Director of the IMF must review an analysis of the program's impact on basic human needs, or prepare their own analysis if one is not available.

The law also requires US representatives to the IMF and the World Bank to work towards improving coordination among these institutions and to promote programs that will promote employment, investment, real income per capita, income distribution, and social programs such as health, housing, and education. The law also requests periodic analyses of the impact of economic adjustment programs on basic human needs. 

Overall, the law aims to ensure that economic adjustment programs supported by IMF and World Bank resources do not have a negative impact on basic human needs, and that longer term efforts are made to promote sustained growth and improved living conditions. Some critics may argue that the effectiveness of this law is limited by the power dynamics between developed and developing countries, and that the IMF and World Bank may prioritize the interests of developed countries over the basic human needs of developing countries.

Page Title:  22 U.S. Code § 286t -  Omitted 
Tab Content: 






This is a US law that has been omitted from the official code, which means it is no longer in effect. It is unclear when or why it was removed, but some speculate that it may have become outdated or irrelevant over time. It is like an old, dusty book that has been taken off the shelf and forgotten about. It may have once had an important purpose, but now it serves no real function. Without more information, it is difficult to say what this law pertained to or what impact it may have had on society.

Tab Content: 




It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall encourage member countries of the Fund to negotiate a dollar-Special Drawing Rights substitution account in which equitable burden sharing would exist among participants in the account.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 35, as added Pub. L. 96–389, § 4(b), Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1554; amended Pub. L. 97–35, title XIII, § 1371(a)(2), Aug. 13, 1981, 95 Stat. 746.)



This law encourages the Secretary of the Treasury and the US Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund to push for a substitution account that would allow for fair sharing of financial burdens among member countries. This law was added in 1980 and amended in 1981. It can be viewed as a way to promote financial stability and cooperation among member countries.

Page Title:  22 U.S. Code § 286v -  Membership for Taiwan in Fund 
Tab Content: 




It is the sense of the Congress that it is the policy of the United States that Taiwan (before January 1, 1979, known as the Republic of China) shall be granted appropriate membership in the Fund and that the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall so notify the Fund.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 36, as added Pub. L. 96–389, § 6, Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1554.)



This law, added in 1980, expresses the opinion of the US Congress that Taiwan should be granted membership in the Fund. The Fund refers to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is an international organization that aims to promote global monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability. Taiwan, formerly known as the Republic of China, has been seeking to gain membership in various international organizations despite opposition from China, which considers Taiwan to be a province of China. This law is one of the ways in which the US has supported Taiwan's bid for international recognition.

Tab Content: 




It is the policy of the United States that the Palestine Liberation Organization should not be given membership in the Fund or be given observer status or any other official status at any meeting sponsored by or associated with the Fund. The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall promptly notify the Fund of such policy.
In the event that the Fund provides either membership, observer status, or any other official status to the Palestine Liberation Organization, such action would result in a serious diminution of United States support. Upon review of such action, the President would be required to report his recommendations to the Congress with regard to any further United States participation in the Fund.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 37, as added Pub. L. 96–389, § 7, Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1554.)



This law states that the Palestine Liberation Organization is not allowed to be a member or have any official status within a certain fund, and if they are granted such status, the US will reduce its support. The President must report to Congress with recommendations if this were to occur. This law was added in 1980 and was likely in response to tensions between the US and Palestine at the time. It can be compared to a parent setting boundaries for their child and punishing them if they disobey.

Tab Content: 




It is the sense of the Congress that in providing assistance through loans or other means to any nation, in particular El Salvador and Nicaragua, the Fund and the Bank should encourage programs which assist the private sector to create an environment which will stabilize the economy of the nation; and that the United States representatives to the Fund and the Bank shall promote the use of assistance by the Fund and the Bank to encourage such programs.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 38, as added Pub. L. 96–389, § 8, Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1554.)



This law emphasizes the importance of supporting the private sector in nations like El Salvador and Nicaragua in order to stabilize their economies. The United States representatives to the Fund and Bank are encouraged to promote the use of assistance for such programs. This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1980.

Tab Content: 



(a) In order to help assure that the resources provided under section 286e–1i of this title are used to support pro-growth policies which will help establish the economic conditions necessary for more appropriate financial and exchange rate alignment and stability, it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury shall—
(1)
 in consultation with the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative, initiate discussions with other countries regarding the economic dislocations which result from structural exchange rate imbalances; and

(2)
 instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to work for adoption of policies in the Fund, both within the framework of article IV (of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund) consultations and with respect to the conditions associated with Fund-supported balance of payments adjustments programs, which promote conditions contributing to the stability of exchange rates and avoid the manipulation of exchange rates between major currencies. Among other initiatives, the Secretary of the Treasury shall propose strengthening the article IV consultation procedures of the Fund to attempt to ensure that countries which are artificially maintaining undervalued or overvalued rates of exchange agree to adopt market determined exchange rates.


(b)
 In determining his vote on extensions of assistance to any Fund borrower, the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall take into account whether such borrower’s policies are consistent with the requirements of article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 40, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 801], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1267.)



This section of the U.S. Code outlines Congress' expectations for the Secretary of the Treasury in promoting exchange rate stability through discussions with other countries and directing the United States Executive Director of the Fund to adopt policies that avoid manipulation of exchange rates. It also requires the Executive Director to consider the borrower's policies in determining whether to extend assistance. This law was added in 1983 as part of efforts to address structural exchange rate imbalances. It reflects concerns about countries artificially maintaining undervalued or overvalued exchange rates and the need for market-determined rates.

Page Title:  22 U.S. Code § 286z -  Collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems 
Tab Content: 



(a) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that—
(1)
 the lack of sufficient information currently available to allow members of the Fund to make sound and prudent decisions concerning their public and private sector international borrowing, and to allow lenders to make sound and prudent decisions concerning their international lending, threatens the stability of the international monetary system; and

(2)
 in recognition of the Fund’s duties, as provided particularly by article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, to act as a center for the collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems, the Fund should adopt necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that more complete and timely financial information will be available.


(b) Initiation by United States Executive Director of discussions with other Directors; adoption of proceduresTo this end, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to initiate discussions with other directors of the Fund and with Fund management, and to propose and vote for, the adoption of procedures, within the Fund—
(1) to collect and disseminate information, on a quarterly basis, from and to Fund members, and to such other persons as the Fund deems appropriate, concerning—
(A)
 the extension of credit by banks or nonbanks to private and public entities, including all government entities, instrumentalities, and central banks of member countries; and

(B)
 the receipt of such credit by those private and public entities of member countries, where such banks or nonbanks are not principally established within the borders of the member country to which the credits are extended; and


(2)
 to disseminate publicly information which is developed in the course of the Fund’s collection, and to review and comment on efforts which the Fund determines would serve to enhance the informational base upon which international borrowing and lending decisions are taken.


(c) “Credit” definedFor purposes of this section, the term “credit” includes—
(1)
 outstanding loans to private and public entities, including government entities, instrumentalities, and central banks of any member, and

(2)
 unused lines of credit which have been made available to those private and public entities of any member,

where such loans or lines of credit are repayable in freely convertible currency.

(d) Providing necessary information

The President is authorized to use the authority provided under section 286f of this title to require any person (as defined in such section) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide such information as the Fund determines to be necessary in order to carry out the provisions of this section.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 42, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 802(a)(4)], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1269.)



This law, enacted in 1983, emphasizes the importance of collecting and exchanging information on monetary and financial issues to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. The law mandates that the US Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) initiate discussions with other directors and management of the IMF to propose procedures for collecting and disseminating information on credit extension and dissemination publicly available information. The law defines credit to include outstanding loans and unused lines of credit repayable in freely convertible currency. The President is authorized to use Section 286f to require persons subject to the US jurisdiction to provide necessary information to the IMF. Overall, the law seeks to enhance the informational base for international borrowing and lending decisions.

Tab Content: 



The Congress hereby finds that Communist dictatorships result in severe constraints on labor and capital mobility and other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities which contribute to balance of payments deficits in direct contradiction of the goals of the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to actively oppose any facility involving use of Fund credit by any Communist dictatorship, unless the Secretary of the Treasury certifies and documents in writing upon request and so notifies and appears, if requested, before the Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committees of the Senate and the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, at least twenty-one days in advance of any vote on such drawing that such drawing—
(1)
 provides the basis for correcting the balance of payments difficulties and restoring a sustainable balance of payments position;

(2)
 would reduce the severe constraints on labor and capital mobility or other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities and advances market-oriented forces in that country; and

(3)
 is in the best economic interest of the majority of the people in that country.

Should the Secretary not meet a request to appear before the aforementioned committees at least twenty-one days in advance of any vote on any facility involving use of Fund credit by any communist dictatorship and certify and document in writing that these three conditions have been met, the United States Executive Director shall vote against such program.
(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 43, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 804], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1270; amended Pub. L. 103–149, § 4(b)(6), Nov. 23, 1993, 107 Stat. 1505.)



This law states that the United States Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund should actively oppose any facility involving the use of Fund credit by any Communist dictatorship, unless certain conditions are met. These conditions involve correcting balance of payments difficulties, reducing constraints on labor and capital mobility, and serving the best economic interests of the majority of people in the country. The Secretary of the Treasury must certify and document these conditions in writing and appear before certain congressional committees if requested. If the Secretary does not meet these requirements, the United States Executive Director must vote against the program. The law was added in 1983 and amended in 1993.

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to propose and work for the adoption of a policy encouraging Fund members to eliminate all predatory agricultural export subsidies which might result in the reduction of other member countries’ exports.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 44, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 805], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1271.)



This law, added in 1983, instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to encourage the elimination of predatory agricultural export subsidies that could harm other countries' exports. The law aims to promote fair trade practices in the agricultural industry. It was added to the U.S. Code, which is a collection of federal laws that are currently in effect in the United States. While some may view this law as a positive step towards fair trade, others may be skeptical of its effectiveness or jaded by the history of international trade negotiations.

Tab Content: 



(a) Economic adjustment programs
(1)
 The President shall instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and other appropriate Federal officials, and shall request the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to use all appropriate means to encourage countries to formulate economic adjustment programs to deal with their balance of payment difficulties and external debt owed to private banks.

(2)
 Such economic adjustment programs should be designed to safeguard, to the maximum extent feasible, international economic growth, world trade, employment, and the long-term solvency of banks, and to minimize the likelihood of civil disturbances in countries needing economic adjustment programs.


(b) Changes in Fund guidelines; limitations on debt service exceptionsTo ensure the effectiveness of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources—
(1) the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall recommend and shall work for changes in Fund guidelines, policies, and decisions which would—
(A)
 convert short-term bank debt which was made at high interest rates into long-term debt at lower rates of interest;

(B)
 assure that the annual external debt service, which shall include principal, interest, points, fees, and other charges required of the country involved, is a manageable and prudent percentage of the projected annual export earnings of such country; and

(C)
 provide that in approving any economic adjustment program the Fund shall take into account the number of countries applying to the Fund for economic adjustment programs and the aggregate effects that such programs will have on international economic growth, world trade, exports and employment of other member countries, and the long-term solvency of banks; and


(2) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall oppose and vote against providing assistance from the Fund for any economic adjustment program for a country in which the annual external debt service exceeds 85 per centum of the annual export earnings of such country, unless the Secretary of the Treasury first determines and provides written documentation to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives that—
(A)
 the economic adjustment program converts high interest rate, short-term bank debt into long-term debt at significantly narrower interest rate spreads than the average interest rate spreads prevailing on bank debt reschedulings negotiated between August 1982 and August 1983 for countries receiving assistance from the Fund for economic adjustment programs in order to minimize the burdens of adjustment on the debtor nation, provided that such interest rate spreads are consistent with that nation’s need to obtain adequate external private financing;

(B)
 the annual external debt service required of the country involved is a manageable and prudent percentage of the projected annual export earnings of such country; and

(C)
 the economic adjustment program will not have an adverse impact on international economic growth, world trade, exports, and employment of other member countries, and the long-term solvency of banks.



(c) Emergencies and extraordinary circumstancesThe provisions of subsection (b)(2) shall not apply in any case in which the Secretary of the Treasury first determines and provides written documentation to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives that—
(1)
 an emergency exists in a nation that has applied to the Fund for assistance that requires an immediate short-term loan to avoid disrupting orderly financial markets;

(2)
 a sudden decrease in export earnings in the country applying to the Fund for assistance has increased the ratio of annual external debt service to annual export earnings, to greater than 85 per centum for a period projected to be no more than one year; or

(3)
 other extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant waiving the provisions of subsection (b)(2).


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 45, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 806], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1272.)



This code outlines the responsibilities of the President and other federal officials in encouraging countries to create economic adjustment programs to deal with balance of payment difficulties and external debt. These programs should prioritize international economic growth, world trade, employment, and bank solvency, while minimizing civil disturbances. The code also includes guidelines for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure the effectiveness of economic adjustment programs, such as converting short-term bank debt into long-term debt at lower interest rates and limiting annual external debt service to a manageable percentage of projected export earnings. Exceptions are allowed for emergencies or extraordinary circumstances. This code was added in 1983.

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund—
(1)
 to oppose and vote against any Fund drawing by a member country where, in his judgment, the Fund resources would be drawn principally for the purpose of repaying loans which have been imprudently made by banking institutions to the member country; and

(2)
 to work to insure that the Fund encourages borrowing countries and banking institutions to negotiate, where appropriate, a rescheduling of debt which is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and the country’s ability to pay.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 46, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 807], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1273.)



This law, added in 1983, instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to oppose any request for funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) made by a member country if the funds would only be used to pay back imprudent loans made by banks. Additionally, the law encourages the negotiation of debt rescheduling that is both safe and in the country's ability to pay. This law was likely enacted as a response to concerns about the use of IMF funds to bail out failing banks or irresponsible borrowing by member countries.

Tab Content: 



The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to propose that the Fund adopt the following policies with respect to international lending:
(1) In its consultations with a member government on its economic policies pursuant to article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, the Fund should—
(A)
 intensify its examination of the trend and volume of external indebtedness of private and public borrowers in the member country and comment, as appropriate, in its report to the Executive Board from the viewpoint of the contribution of such borrowings to the economic stability of the borrower; and

(B)
 consider to what extent and in what form these comments might be made available to the international banking community and the public.


(2)
 As part of any Fund-approved stabilization program, the Fund should give consideration to placing limits on public sector external short- and long-term borrowing.

(3)
 As a part of its annual report, and at such times as it may consider desirable, the Fund should publish its evaluation of the trend and volume of international lending as it affects the economic situation of lenders, borrowers, and the smooth functioning of the international monetary system.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 47, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 809], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1274.)



This law instructs the Secretary of Treasury to ask the United States Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to adopt policies for international lending. The IMF should examine the external debt of member countries and comment on it in their reports to the Executive Board. They should also consider making these comments available to the international banking community and the public. The IMF should limit public sector external borrowing as part of any approved stabilization program. The IMF should also publish evaluations of international lending trends in their annual reports. This law was added to the United States Code in 1983. This law is essentially a way for the United States to encourage the IMF to take a closer look at the impact of international lending on borrowers and lenders and ensure that it contributes to economic stability.

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to propose and work for the adoption of Fund policies regarding the rate of remuneration paid on use of member’s quota subscriptions and the rate of charges on Fund drawings to bring those rates in line with market rates.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 48, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 810], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1274.)



This law requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make sure the Fund (presumably referring to the International Monetary Fund, or IMF) sets interest rates for member countries' contributions and loans that are in line with market rates. This law was added in 1983 and is still in effect. It's like the government telling the IMF to keep up with the times and not charge outdated interest rates. It's similar to a bank adjusting its interest rates based on current market conditions.

(b) Agreement to eliminate unfair trade practices as condition of financial assistance
(1)
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each of the banks and of the Fund, prior to the extension to any country of financial assistance by the banks and by the Fund, to work to have the banks and the Fund obtain the agreement of such country to eliminate, in a manner consistent with its balance of payments adjustment program, unfair trade and investment practices with respect to goods and services which the United States Trade Representative, after consultation with the Trade Policy Committee, has determined to have a significant deleterious effect on the international trading system.

(2) Such practices include—
(A)
 the provision of predatory export subsidies, employed in connection with the exporting of agricultural commodities and products thereof to foreign countries;

(B)
 the provision of other export subsidies, such as government subsidized below-market interest rate financing for commodities or manufactured goods;

(C)
 unreasonable import restrictions;

(D)
 the imposition of trade-related performance requirements on foreign investment; and

(E)
 practices which are inconsistent with international agreements.



(c) United States position on requests for loans or drawing under bank and Fund programs; progress made in eliminating unfair trade practices

 In determining the United States position on requests for loans or periodic drawing under bank and Fund programs, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take full account of the progress countries have made in achieving targets for eliminating or phasing out the practices referred to in subsection (b) of this section.

(2)
 In the event that the United States supports a request for loans or drawing by a country that has not achieved the bank and Fund targets relating to such practices specified in its program, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to the appropriate committees of the Congress the reasons for the United States position.

Summary:

22 U.S. Code § 286gg is a law that instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to work with the United States Executive Director of each of the multilateral development banks to develop financial assistance policies that promote fair trade. These policies should reduce obstacles to international trade and investment, eliminate unfair trade and investment practices, and promote mutually beneficial economic relations. The law also requires the banks to obtain the agreement of recipient countries to eliminate unfair trade practices as a condition of financial assistance. The law defines “multilateral development banks” as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

Analogy:
This law is like a teacher who tells their students to work together to develop a fair and just system for sharing toys. The teacher instructs the students to eliminate unfair practices like hoarding toys or only trading with their friends, and to promote a mutually beneficial sharing environment.

Tab Content: 



(a) CriteriaThe Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to advocate and support the facilitation of voluntary market-based programs for the reduction of sovereign debt and the promotion of sustainable economic development, which, if implemented, would—
(1)
 not require any organization or government to participate in such a program;

(2)
 result in debt reduction for each participating country tailored to the particular situation of each country;

(3)
 provide assistance to participating countries conditioned on the implementation of economic reforms, and the preservation of economic reforms previously implemented, by the country that are consistent with the principles of sustainable development;

(4)
 encourage participating countries to make economic adjustments steadily and over a period of time in order to achieve policy reform;

(5)
 use debt reduction techniques that would not compensate commercial banks for the reduction in the value of such debt, but would serve as a catalyst for new lending;

(6)
 involve such bank in lending for purposes of debt reduction and conversion only where such involvement would not lower the credit-worthiness of such bank;

(7)
 not require public sector funding beyond that provided through any capital increase for such bank, and any replenishment for the International Development Association, which is agreed to by the member countries of such institutions; and

(8)
 accomplish debt reduction, not as an end, but as a means to greater growth and investment in, and the restoration of voluntary private lending to, participating countries for environmentally and economically sustainable development.


(b) Policy based lending for debt reduction and sustainable growth

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to propose that policy based loans be made by such bank for, among other reasons, facilitating a reduction in the debt service burden of any country which is participating in a voluntary market-based program for debt reduction described in subsection (c).


(c) Voluntary market-based program for debt reduction and sustainable growth

In connection with the discussions initiated pursuant to subsection (b), the Secretary shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to propose that a country be considered to be participating in a voluntary market-based program of debt reduction for purposes of subsection (b) if the creditors of such country agree to significantly reduce the debt service of such country through forgiveness of a percentage of the interest owed by such country on any sovereign debt or through any other means.


(d) ReportsNot later than March 1, 1989, March 1, 1991, and March 1, 1993, respectively, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 3 reports each of which—
(1)
 describes the long term strategy and lending programs of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for reducing and managing the debt burden of the countries designated as “Highly Indebted Countries” in the 1987–1988 World Debt Tables published by such bank, and summarize the long term strategy and lending programs of such bank for other seriously indebted countries;

(2)
 contains an explanation of the measures taken by such bank to facilitate the reduction of the debt burden of the countries designated as “Highly Indebted Countries” in the 1987–1988 World Debt tables [1] published by such bank;

(3)
 describes the extent (if any) to which such bank has implemented the measures described in subsections (b) and (c); and

(4)
 describes the success each of such countries has had in managing and reducing their debt burdens and achieving sustainable and equitable economic growth as measured by criteria including the ratio of debt service to exports, the ratio of debt to gross national product, net resource flows, and per capita income.


(e) Review by House Banking Committee

On receipt of each report required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (d), and after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives shall forward such report to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives with an assessment by the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs describing the effect on the international debt situation of funding the subscription of the United States to the shares of capital stock of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development due for payment by the United States in the then next fiscal year.


(Pub. L. 100–461, title V, § 555, Oct. 1, 1988, 102 Stat. 2268–36; Pub. L. 111–203, title IX, § 939(f), July 21, 2010, 124 Stat. 1886.)



Summary:

22 U.S. Code § 286hh outlines policies for market-based programs aimed at reducing sovereign debt and promoting sustainable economic development. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to initiate discussions with the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other directors to advocate for such programs. Criteria for the programs include tailored debt reduction for participating countries, economic reforms consistent with sustainable development, and debt reduction techniques that do not compensate commercial banks. Policy-based loans can be made by the bank to facilitate a reduction in debt service burden for countries participating in the program. Reports on the success of the program are to be submitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Analogy:

Think of a debt relief program for countries that is market-based, voluntary, and tailored to the specific needs of each country. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, this program would incentivize economic reforms and steady adjustments aimed at promoting sustainable development. The success of the program would be measured by metrics such as debt service to exports, debt to gross national product, and per capita income.

Timeline:

- October 1, 1988: The policy is established with the passage of Pub. L. 100–461, title V, § 555.
- July 21, 2010: A small amendment is made to the legislation with the passage of Pub. L. 111–203, title IX, § 939(f).

Tab Content: 



The Secretary of the Treasury shall—
(1) take all necessary steps to encourage the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to limit—
(A)
 the aggregate value of the policy based loans made by such bank (other than for the purpose described in section 286hh(b) of this title) in any fiscal year of such bank beginning after June 30, 1989, to 25 percent of the aggregate value of all loans made by such bank in such fiscal year; and

(B)
 the aggregate value of the policy based loans made by such bank to the government of a particular country (other than for the purpose described in section 286hh(b) of this title) in any fiscal year of such bank beginning after June 30, 1989, and occurring during any period of 3 consecutive fiscal years of such bank (determined after disregarding any such fiscal year in which such bank did not make a policy based loan to such government), to 50 percent of the aggregate value of all loans made by such bank to such government during such 3-year period;


(2)
 instruct the United States Executive Director of such bank to propose and actively seek the adoption by the board of Executive Directors of such bank of a resolution establishing as official bank operating policy for fiscal years 1990 through 1995 of such bank the limits specified in paragraph (1); and

(3)
 until the resolution described in paragraph (2) is adopted, undertake, in consultation with the Secretary of State, discussions with other member country governments to secure the consent and cooperation of such governments with respect to the adoption of the limits specified in paragraph (1).

(Pub. L. 100–461, title V, § 555, Oct. 1, 1988, 102 Stat. 2268–36.)



This law sets limitations on policy-based lending by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and requires the US Secretary of Treasury to take necessary steps to encourage the IBRD to limit such lending. The aggregate value of policy-based loans by the IBRD in any fiscal year must not exceed 25% of all loans made in such fiscal year, and loans to a particular government must not exceed 50% of all loans made to that government during any three consecutive fiscal years. The US Executive Director of the IBRD must actively seek the adoption of these limits by the board of Executive Directors, and until then, the Secretary of Treasury must engage in discussions with other member countries to secure their consent and cooperation. This law was enacted in 1988 and applies to fiscal years 1990 through 1995.

Tab Content: 




The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to propose that such bank establish criteria under which such bank would provide partial guarantees on debt service payments by borrower countries to private creditors when such guarantees would serve a catalytic role in facilitating final agreement on financing packages which involve significant debt reduction.

(Pub. L. 100–461, title V, § 555, Oct. 1, 1988, 102 Stat. 2268–36.)



This law instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to have discussions with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development about providing partial guarantees on debt service payments to private creditors for borrower countries that are seeking significant debt reduction. The goal is to help facilitate final agreements on financing packages. This law was enacted in 1988 and has no commonly referred counterparts.

Tab Content: 



The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to seek policy changes by the Fund, through formal initiatives and through bilateral discussions, which will result in—
(1)
 the initiation of a systematic review of policy prescriptions implemented by the Fund, for the purpose of determining whether the Fund’s objectives were met and the social and environmental impacts of such policy prescriptions; and

(2)
 the establishment of procedures which ensure the inclusion, in future economic reform programs approved by the Fund, of policy options which eliminate or reduce the potential adverse impact on the well-being of the poor or the environment resulting from such programs.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 55, as added Pub. L. 101–240, title III, § 302, Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2500.)



This law requires the Secretary of the Treasury to tell the US Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to try to make the IMF change its policies so that they don't hurt poor people or the environment. The IMF has to review its policies and make sure they don't have bad effects on these groups, and make sure that future policies don't hurt them either. This law was added in 1989 by the US Congress. It's sort of like telling a boss to make sure their company's actions don't harm the little guys, and to fix things if they do. It's been over 30 years since this law was added, so it's unclear how effective it has been or if it needs updating.

Tab Content: 



(a) Policy changes within IMFThe Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to promote regularly and vigorously in program discussions and quota increase negotiations the following proposals:
(1) Poverty alleviation, reduction of barriers to economic and social progress, and progress toward environmentally sound policies and programs
(A)
(i)
 Considerations of poverty alleviation and the reduction of barriers to economic and social progress should be incorporated into all Fund programs and all consultations under article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund.

(ii)
 Preparation of Policy Framework Papers should be extended to all nations which have Fund programs and active Bank or International Development Association lending programs, and existence of a Policy Framework Paper should be a precondition for new lending to such nations by the Fund.

(iii)
 All Policy Framework Papers should articulate the principal poverty, economic, and social measures that the borrowing nation needs to address, and this portion of the Policy Framework Paper (or a summary thereof that includes specific measures and timing) should be made available when the Policy Framework Paper is submitted to the Executive Directors of the Bank and of the Fund for consideration.

(iv)
 In considering whether to allocate resources of the Fund to a borrower, the Fund should take into consideration the nature of the program and commitment of the borrower to address the issues referred to in clause (iii).

(v)
 The Fund should establish procedures to enable the Fund to cooperate with the Bank in evaluating the effectiveness of the measures referred to in clause (iii), at the levels of policy, project design, monitoring, and reporting, in the international financial institutions and in the borrowing nations.


(B)
(i)
 The Fund should be encouraged to make further progress toward environmentally sound policies and programs.

(ii)
 The Fund should incorporate environmental considerations into all Fund programs, including consultations under article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund.

(v)
 The Fund should be encouraged to consider and implement, as appropriate, revisions in its national income reporting systems consistent with such new systems as are of general applicability.



(2) Policy audits
(A)
 The Fund should conduct periodic audits to review systematically the policy prescriptions recommended and required by the Fund in the areas of poverty and the environment.

(B) The purposes of such audits would be—
(i)
 to determine whether the Fund’s objectives were met; and

(ii)
 to evaluate the social and environmental impacts of the implementation of the policy prescriptions.


(C)
 Such audits would have access to all ongoing programs and activities of the Fund and the ability to review the effects of Fund-supported programs, on a country-by-country basis, with respect to poverty, economic development, and environment.

(D)
 Such audits should be made public as appropriate with due respect to confidentiality.


(3) Ensuring policy options that increase the productive participation of the poor

The Fund should establish procedures that ensure the focus of future economic reform programs approved by the Fund on policy options that increase the productive participation of the poor in the economy.


(4) Public access to information
(A)
 The Fund should establish procedures for public access to information.

(B)
 Such procedures shall seek to ensure access of the public to information while paying due regard to appropriate confidentiality.

(C)
 Policy Framework Papers and the supporting documents prepared by the Fund’s mission to a country are examples of documents that should be made public at an appropriate time and in appropriate ways.



(b) Progress reportEach annual report of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies shall describe the following:
(1)
 The actions that the United States Executive Director and other officials have taken to convince the Fund to adopt the proposals set forth in subsection (a) through formal initiatives before the Board and management of the Fund, through bilateral discussions with other member nations, and through any further quota increase negotiations.

(2)
 The status of the progress being made by the Fund in implementing the proposals set forth in subsection (a).


(c) StudyThe Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director to the Fund to urge the Fund—
(1)
 to explore ways to increase the involvement and participation of important ministries, national development experts, environmental experts, free-market experts, and other legitimate experts and representatives from the loan-recipient country in the development of Fund programs; and

(2)
 to report on the status of Fund efforts in this regard.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 59, as added Pub. L. 102–511, title X, § 1002, Oct. 24, 1992, 106 Stat. 3357.)



This section of the U.S. Code outlines policy changes to be promoted by the Secretary of the Treasury within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including incorporating poverty alleviation and environmental considerations into all Fund programs, conducting periodic policy audits, and ensuring policies that increase the productive participation of the poor. The annual report of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies must describe the actions taken and progress made by the Fund in implementing these proposals. The Secretary of the Treasury is also instructed to urge the Fund to increase the involvement and participation of experts from loan-recipient countries in the development of Fund programs. Added to the U.S. Code in 1992, this section reflects growing concerns about the social and environmental impacts of international financial policies.

(a) Development by Fund of means to measure military spending
(1) Position of the United States

The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall use the voice and vote of the United States to urge the Fund, in consultation with the Bank, to continue to develop an economic methodology to measure the level of military spending by each developing country.


(2) Progress report to the Congress

No later than 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on the status of the development by the Fund of a workable economic methodology to measure military spending by developing countries.



(b) Annual reports by Fund on levels of military spending

The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall use the voice and vote of the United States to urge the Fund, beginning with 1994, to provide the Executive Board of the Fund with annual reports stating the estimate by the Fund of the level of military spending by each developing country in the immediately preceding calendar year (or, with respect to developing countries whose fiscal years are not calendar years, in the most recently completed fiscal year of the developing country), not later than the date of the annual fall Interim and Development Committee meetings.


(c) Analysis and assessment of military spending to be included in article IV consultations by Fund

The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall use the voice and vote of the United States to urge the Fund, beginning no later than the date of the first report provided as described in subsection (b), to include in every article IV consultation with a developing country an analysis of the level of military spending by the developing country in the immediately preceding calendar year (or, with respect to developing countries whose fiscal years are not calendar years, in the most recently completed fiscal year of the developing country).


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 60, as added Pub. L. 102–511, title X, § 1003, Oct. 24, 1992, 106 Stat. 3359.)



This section of U.S. Code makes provisions for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to develop a methodology for measuring military spending by developing nations. The U.S. Executive Director of the Fund is required to use their voice and vote to urge the IMF to continue this work and provide progress reports to Congress. The Fund is also required to provide annual reports on the estimate of military spending by each developing country and include analysis of military spending in every article IV consultation with a developing country. This provision was added to the U.S. Code in 1992. It reflects a concern among some policymakers about the negative economic impact of high military spending in developing nations. The provision seeks to encourage transparency and accountability in military spending and promote economic development in these countries. It is unclear how effective this provision has been in achieving these goals.

Tab Content: 



For the purpose of mobilizing the resources of the Fund in order to help reduce poverty and improve the lives of residents of poor countries and, in particular, to allow those poor countries with unsustainable debt burdens to receive deeper, broader, and faster debt relief, without allowing gold to reach the open market or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to vote—
(1) to approve an arrangement whereby the Fund—
(A)
 sells a quantity of its gold at prevailing market prices to a member or members in nonpublic transactions sufficient to generate 2.226 billion Special Drawing Rights in profits on such sales;

(B)
 immediately after, and in conjunction with each such sale, accepts payment by such member or members of such gold to satisfy existing repurchase obligations of such member or members so that the Fund retains ownership of the gold at the conclusion of such payment; and

(C)
 uses the earnings on the investment of the profits of such sales through a separate subaccount, only for the purpose of providing debt relief from the Fund under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative (as defined in section 262p–6 of this title); and


(2)
 to support a decision that shall terminate the Special Contingency Account 2 (SCA–2) of the Fund so that the funds in the SCA–2 shall be made available to the poorest countries. Any funds attributable to the United States participation in SCA–2 shall be used only for debt relief from the Fund under the modified HIPC Initiative.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 62, as added Pub. L. 106–113, div. B, § 1000(a)(5) [title V, § 503(a)], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A–316; amended Pub. L. 106–429, § 101(a) [title VIII, § 801(a)], Nov. 6, 2000, 114 Stat. 1900, 1900A–64.)



The 22 U.S. Code § 286nn is a provision that allows the United States to approve contributions for debt reductions for the poorest countries. It authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to vote in support of selling a quantity of IMF's gold to generate profits, which will be used for debt relief in poor countries. The provision also terminates the Special Contingency Account 2 (SCA–2) of the IMF and makes the funds available for debt relief for the poorest countries. This provision was added in 1999 and amended in 2000. Critics may view this provision as a band-aid solution to a larger systemic issue of unsustainable debt burdens and poverty in developing countries.

Page Title:  22 U.S. Code § 286oo -  Principles for International Monetary Fund lending 
Tab Content: 



It is the policy of the United States to work to implement reforms in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to achieve the following goals:
(1) Short-term balance of payments financing

Lending from the general resources of the Fund should concentrate chiefly on short-term balance of payments financing.


(2) Limitations on medium-term financingUse of medium-term lending from the general resources of the Fund should be limited to a set of well-defined circumstances, such as—
(A)
 when a member’s balance of payments problems will be protracted;

(B)
 such member has a strong structural reform program in place; and

(C)
 the member has little or no access to private sources of capital.


(3) Premium pricing

Premium pricing should be introduced for lending from the general resources of the Fund, for greater than 200 percent of a member’s quota in the Fund, to discourage excessive use of Fund lending and to encourage members to rely on private financing to the maximum extent possible.


(4) Redressing misreporting of informationThe Fund should have in place and apply systematically a strong framework of safeguards and measures to respond to, correct, and discourage cases of misreporting of information in the context of a Fund program, including—
(A)
 suspending Fund disbursements and ensuring that Fund lending is not resumed to members that engage in serious misreporting of material information until such time as remedial actions and sanctions, as appropriate, have been applied;

(B)
 ensuring that members make early repayments, where appropriate, of Fund resources disbursed on the basis of misreported information;

(C)
 making public cases of serious misreporting of material information;

(D)
 requiring all members receiving new disbursements from the Fund to undertake annually independent audits of central bank financial statements and publish the resulting audits; and

(E)
 requiring all members seeking new loans from the Fund to provide to the Fund detailed information regarding their internal control procedures, financial reporting and audit mechanisms and, in cases where there are questions about the adequacy of these systems, undertaking an on-site review and identifying needed remedies.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 63, as added Pub. L. 106–429, § 101(a) [title VIII, § 805], Nov. 6, 2000, 114 Stat. 1900, 1900A–67.)



This law outlines principles for how the International Monetary Fund should lend money to countries in need of short-term balance of payments financing or medium-term financing under specific circumstances. It also introduces premium pricing for loans over 200% of a member's quota to deter excessive use of Fund lending and encourage reliance on private financing. Additionally, the law calls for measures to address cases of misreporting of information, including suspending Fund disbursements to members that engage in serious misreporting and requiring independent audits of central bank financial statements. The law was added in 2000 as part of ongoing efforts to reform the IMF.

The United States Governor of the Fund may consent to an increase in the quota of the United States in the Fund equivalent to 4,973,100,000 Special Drawing Rights.


(b) Subject to appropriations

The authority provided by subsection (a) shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriations Acts.

This law allows the United States to increase its quota in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to a specific amount, which is equivalent to a certain number of Special Drawing Rights (a type of international reserve asset). However, this authority is subject to being funded by Congress through appropriations. This law was added in 2009, during a time of global economic uncertainty and recession, and was likely intended to strengthen the US's ability to participate in international financial efforts.

(a) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to vote to approve the sale of up to 12,965,649 ounces of the Fund’s gold acquired since the second Amendment to the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, only if such sales are consistent with the guidelines agreed to by the Executive Board of the Fund described in the Report of the Managing Director to the International Monetary and Financial Committee on a New Income and Expenditure Framework for the International Monetary Fund (April 9, 2008) to prevent disruption to the world gold market: Provided, That at least 30 days prior to any such vote, the Secretary shall consult with the appropriate congressional committees regarding the use of proceeds from the sale of such gold: Provided further, That the Secretary of the Treasury shall seek to ensure that:
(1)
 the Fund will provide support to low-income countries that are eligible for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility or other low-income lending from the Fund by making available Fund resources of not less than $4,000,000,000;

(2)
 such Fund resources referenced above will be used to leverage additional support by a significant multiple to provide loans with substantial concessionality and debt service payment relief and/or grants, as appropriate to a country’s circumstances: [1]

This law allows the Secretary of the Treasury to approve the sale of up to a limited amount of the International Monetary Fund's gold, as long as it aligns with certain guidelines to prevent disruption in the gold market. The Secretary must also consult with congressional committees prior to any vote. The proceeds from the sale must be used to provide support to low-income countries, with a minimum of $4 billion in Fund resources and a focus on loans with substantial concessionality and debt service payment relief and/or grants. The support must be provided for at least two years, and a significant amount must be delivered within the first two years. The United States Governor is authorized to use the proceeds to assist low-income countries as well. This law was added in 2009.

The United States Governor of the Fund may agree to and accept the amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund as proposed in the resolution numbered 52–4 of the Board of Governors of the Fund which was approved by such Board on October 22, 1997: Provided, That not more than one year after the acceptance of such amendments to the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees analyzing Special Drawing Rights, to include a discussion of how those countries that significantly use or acquire Special Drawing Rights in accordance with Article XIX, Section 2(c), use or acquire them; the extent to which countries experiencing balance of payment difficulties exchange or use their Special Drawing Rights to acquire reserve currencies; and the manner in which those reserve currencies are acquired when utilizing Special Drawing Rights.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 67, as added Pub. L. 111–32, title XIV, § 1402, June 24, 2009, 123 Stat. 1918; amended Pub. L. 111–117, div. F, title VII, § 7034(q)(1)(A), Dec. 16, 2009, 123 Stat. 3363.)



This law allows the United States Governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to accept an amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund that was proposed in 1997. However, within a year of accepting the amendment, the Secretary of the Treasury must submit a report to congressional committees analyzing how Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are used by countries experiencing balance of payment difficulties. The report must include information on how countries acquire reserve currencies when utilizing SDRs. This law was added in 2009 and amended later that year. It's like agreeing to buy a product but wanting to analyze its usage and benefits before fully committing to it. It's also like the government wanting to do some market research before investing in a new financial tool.
