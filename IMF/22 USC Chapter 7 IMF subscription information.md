Short Title of 1968 Amendment
Pub. L. 90–349, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 188 [enacting sections 286n to 286r of this title and amending sections 412, 415, 417, and 467 of Title 12, Banks and Banking], is known as the “Special Drawing Rights Act”. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 286n of this title and Tables.

Par Value Modification
For Congressional direction that the Secretary of the Treasury maintain the value in terms of gold of the holdings in United States dollars of the International Monetary Fund and of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development following the establishment of a par value of the dollar at $38 for a fine troy ounce of gold pursuant to the Par Value Modification Act and for the authorization of the appropriation necessary to provide such maintenance of value, see section 5152 of Title 31, Money and Finance.









### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286 -  Acceptance of membership by United States in International Monetary Fund 


This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the President to accept membership for the United States in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, often called the World Bank. These financial institutions were established in the Final Act of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944, commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods Conference. The IMF focuses mainly on macroeconomic issues, while the World Bank focuses on poverty reduction and the improvement of living standards worldwide. 

This section also refers to acts related to the U.S.'s financial obligations and responsibilities within these institutions. The Special Drawing Rights Act enacted in 1968, for example, appears to concern the U.S.'s contributions to these institutions and their financial operations. 

Finally, this section refers to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, which was the vehicle for enacting the U.S.'s participation in the IMF and the World Bank. It also mentions the Par Value Modification Act, which appears to pertain to the maintenance of the value of U.S. dollar holdings in these institutions. 

In simpler terms, this part of the U.S. law gives the President the green light to join these major global financial institutions and lays out some of the U.S.'s financial responsibilities within them.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286a -  Appointments 


This section of the U.S. Code deals with the appointments of governors and executive directors to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank). The President, with Senate approval, appoints a governor to both the Fund and the Bank, and an executive director to both. These appointments serve for five years for the governor and two years for the executive directors. Alternates are also appointed in the same manner with the same term lengths.

Additionally, the section outlines that no person shall receive any salary or other compensation from the United States for services as Governor, executive director, councillor, alternate, or associate. The United States executive director of the Fund is further restricted in their compensation from the Fund, with caps set at levels from the Executive Schedule. Lastly, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to assure that salaries and other compensations for the Fund employees do not exceed those received by persons in similar roles within national government service or private industry. 

Amendments made in 1976 and 1978 mainly deal with the provision that the Governor shall also serve as councillor and designate an alternate and associates, and specific compensations caps for United States executive director and alternate executive director of the Fund.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286b -  National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems 


The 22 U.S. Code § 286b outlines the establishment and roles of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems. This Council was established to coordinate U.S. policy and operations in international finance and monetary transactions, as well as foreign loans. The council is composed of major economic and financial figures in the U.S. government, including the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. 

The Council's primary duties include recommending policy guidelines for U.S. representatives in international financial institutions, advising the President on major problems in these institutions, coordinating U.S. policies and operations in foreign loans, and making decisions requiring U.S. approval in the said institutions. They are also tasked to report and recommend to the President anything they deem necessary for the effective and efficient accomplishment of their purpose. 

Lastly, this code mandates U.S. representatives in international financial institutions and other relevant agencies to regularly report their activities to the Council and provide any necessary information for the Council to carry out its responsibilities.

This specific section of the U.S. Code (22 U.S. Code § 286b–1, 286b–2) has been repealed. It previously pertained to mandatory annual reports that the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies was required to submit to Congress.

- Section 286b–1 demanded an annual report from the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies to Congress. This report would typically include information on the council's activities, findings, and recommendations in the area of international monetary and financial policies.

- Section 286b–2, which was added in 1983, required both the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies and the Secretary of the Treasury to submit reports to Congress. The content of these reports is not specified in the repeal note but it likely pertained to the state of the international monetary and financial environment.

However, both these sections were repealed on December 19, 1989, and as such, the requirements they imposed are no longer in effect.

Unless Congress by law authorizes such action, neither the President nor any person or agency shall on behalf of the United States (a) request or consent to any change in the quota of the United States under article III, section 2(a), of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund; (b) propose a par value for the United States dollar under paragraph 2, paragraph 4, or paragraph 10 of schedule C of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund; (c) propose any change in the par value of the United States dollar under paragraph 6 of schedule C of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, or approve any general change in par values under paragraph 11 of schedule C; (d) subscribe to additional shares of stock under article II, section 3, of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank; (e) accept any amendment under article XXVIII of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund or Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank; (f) make any loan to the Fund or the Bank; or (g) approve any disposition of Fund gold, unless the Secretary certifies to the Congress that such disposition is necessary for the Fund to restitute gold to its members, or for the Fund to provide liquidity that will enable the Fund to meet member country claims on the Fund or to meet threats to the systemic stability of the international financial system. Unless Congress by law authorizes such action, no governor or alternate appointed to represent the United States shall vote for an increase of capital stock of the Bank under article II, section 2, of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, if such increase involves an increased subscription on the part of the United States. Neither the President nor any person or agency shall, on behalf of the United States, consent to any borrowing (other than borrowing from a foreign government or other official public source) by the Fund of funds denominated in United States dollars, unless the Secretary of the Treasury transmits a notice of such proposed borrowing to both Houses of the Congress at least 60 days prior to the date on which such borrowing is scheduled to occur.

Editorial Notes
Amendments
1999—Pub. L. 106–113, which directed substitution of “approve any disposition of Fund gold, unless the Secretary certifies to the Congress that such disposition is necessary for the Fund to restitute gold to its members, or for the Fund to provide liquidity that will enable the Fund to meet member country claims on the Fund or to meet threats to the systemic stability of the international financial system.” for “approve either the disposition of more than 25 million ounces of Fund gold for the benefit of the Trust Fund established by the Fund on May 6, 1976, or the establishment of any additional trust fund whereby resources of the International Monetary Fund would be used for the special benefit of a single member, or of a particular segment of the membership, of the Fund.” in cl. (g) of first sentence, was executed by making the substitution for text which ended with “the fund.” rather than “the Fund.”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
1983—Pub. L. 98–181 inserted provision prohibiting the President or any person or agency from consenting to a borrowing of funds denominated in dollars unless notice of such borrowing is transmitted to Congress at least 60 days prior to such borrowing.
1977—Pub. L. 95–147 added to cl. (g) provisions relating to disposition of more than 25 million ounces of Fund gold for the benefit of the Trust Fund.
1976—Pub. L. 94–564 amended cls. (a) to (g) generally.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286c -  Congressional authorization needed for certain actions 


This U.S. law stipulates that certain actions related to the country's financial dealings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) must be authorized by Congress. These actions include changes to the U.S. quota with the IMF, proposing the value of the U.S. dollar, subscribing to additional shares of the World Bank, accepting amendments to the Articles of Agreement of both the IMF and World Bank, lending money to these organizations, and approving the disposition of IMF gold. The law also prohibits the U.S. from consenting to borrow funds from sources other than foreign governments or other official public sources without prior notice to Congress. Various amendments to this law have been made since its enactment in 1945.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286d -  Federal Reserve banks as depositories 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next






Any Federal Reserve bank which is requested to do so by the Fund or the Bank shall act as its depository or as its fiscal agent, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall supervise and direct the carrying out of these functions by the Federal Reserve banks.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 6, 59 Stat. 514.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286d -  Federal Reserve banks as depositories 


This section of U.S. Code allows international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank to request any Federal Reserve bank to act as its depository or as its fiscal agent. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are tasked with overseeing and directing the execution of these roles by the Federal Reserve banks. This law was put into place in July 1945. 

In simpler terms, it's like the IMF or the World Bank asking a local bank to keep their money safe or handle their financial transactions, with the central bank keeping an eye on the process.

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to pay the balance of the subscription of the United States to the Fund not provided for in subsection (a) and to pay the subscription of the United States to the Bank from time to time when payments are required to be made to the Bank. For the purpose of making these payments, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction $8,675,000,000 of the proceeds of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include such purpose. Payment under this paragraph of the subscription of the United States to the Fund or the Bank and repayments thereof shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States.
For the purpose of keeping to a minimum the cost to the United States of participation in the Fund and the Bank, the Secretary of the Treasury, after paying the subscription of the United States to the Fund, and any part of the subscription of the United States to the Bank required to be made under article II, section 7(i), of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, is authorized and directed to issue special notes of the United States from time to time at par and to deliver such notes to the Fund and the Bank in exchange for dollars to the extent permitted by the respective Articles of Agreement. The special notes provided for in this paragraph shall be issued under the authority and subject to the provisions of chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include the purposes for which special notes are authorized and directed to be issued under this paragraph, but such notes shall bear no interest, shall be nonnegotiable, and shall be payable on demand of the Fund or the Bank, as the case may be. The face amount of special notes issued to the Fund under the authority of this paragraph and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed in the aggregate the amount of the subscription of the United States actually paid to the Fund and the dollar equivalent of currencies and gold which the United States shall have purchased from the Fund in accordance with the Articles of Agreement, and the face amount of such notes issued to the Bank and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed in the aggregate the amount of the subscription of the United States actually paid to the Bank under article II, section 7(i) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
Any payment made to the United States by the Fund or the Bank as a distribution of net income shall be covered into the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt.

Increase in Quota of United States; Appropriation Requirements; Transfers and Credits; Restrictions
Pub. L. 96–544, Dec. 17, 1980, 94 Stat. 3213, provided that: 
“For an increase in the United States quota in the International Monetary Fund, the dollar equivalent of 4,202.5 million Special Drawing Rights (approximately $5,537,839,000), to remain available until expended, and balances equivalent to the current SDR value of the United States quota in the Fund shall be merged with this appropriation. Amounts equivalent to the United States reserve position in the Fund shall be credited to this appropriation. Amounts available in this account may be transferred to the Fund by the Secretary of the Treasury to meet United States obligations in the Fund in an amount not to exceed at any time the United States quota in the Fund. The amounts provided for valuation adjustments of Fund holdings of United States dollars shall continue to be available for this purpose and shall be available for transfers to this appropriation account for the purpose of such adjustments. In the administration of these funds it shall be the policy of the United States:
“(1)
 that the Palestine Liberation Organization should not be given membership in the Fund or be given observer status or any other official status at any meeting sponsored by or associated with the Fund;

“(2)
 that the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall promptly notify the Fund of such policy;

“(3)
 that in the event that the Fund provides either membership, observer status, or any other official status to the Palestine Liberation Organization, such action would result in a serious diminution of United States support; and

“(4)
 that upon review of such action, the President would be required to report his recommendations to the Congress with regard to any further United States participation in the Fund.”











### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e -  Payment of subscriptions to Fund and Bank by United States; issuance of special notes; income covered into Treasury 


This law authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the United States' subscription to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) using the proceeds from securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. It also authorizes the issuance of special, non-interest bearing, non-negotiable notes to the IMF and the World Bank in exchange for dollars. The total amount of these special notes issued cannot exceed the total amount of the U.S.'s actual subscription paid to the IMF and the World Bank. Any income received by the U.S. from the IMF or the World Bank is to be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous income.

The law was modified in 1959 and 1962, with the latter amendment allowing the face amount of special notes issued to the IMF to include the dollar equivalent of currencies and gold purchased by the U.S. from the IMF.

The notes also include a reference to a 1980 law that approved an increase in the U.S. quota in the IMF, which also contained a policy statement against the Palestine Liberation Organization gaining membership or official status in the IMF. It stated that if such status was granted, it would result in a decrease in U.S. support and would require the President to report to Congress on further U.S. participation in the IMF.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–1e -  Equivalent increase in quota of United States 


This U.S. Code allows the U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to consent to an increase in the U.S.'s quota in the IMF, equivalent to 1,705 million Special Drawing Rights. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the IMF. This law was added in 1976 and is part of the larger legislative framework that defines the U.S.'s relationship and obligations to the IMF. 

In simpler terms, this law allows the U.S. to contribute more to the IMF if needed, up to a specific amount. This quota is important because it determines a country's voting power in IMF decisions; the larger a country's quota, the more influence it has.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–1g -  Additional increase in quota of United States; condition 


This U.S. law, added in 1980, authorizes the U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to agree to an increase in the U.S. quota in the IMF equivalent to 4,202.5 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a type of international monetary reserve currency created by the IMF. However, this increase is limited to amounts that are appropriated in advance in appropriation Acts. Basically, this law allows the U.S. to increase its IMF quota - which determines its voting power in IMF decisions and its financial commitment to the organization - as long as the necessary funding has been approved in advance by the government.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–1k -  Capital stock increase 


This section of the U.S. Code, 22 U.S. Code § 286e–1k, pertains to an increase in the capital stock of the Bank. The U.S. Governor of the Bank is authorized to vote on two matters: (1) an increase of 620,000 shares in the authorized capital stock of the Bank, and (2) a subscription on behalf of the United States to 116,262 additional shares of the Bank's capital stock. However, the subscription to the additional shares is only allowed to the extent or in amounts provided beforehand in appropriations Acts.

Furthermore, the section authorizes the appropriation of $14,025,266,370, without any fiscal year limitation, for the payment by the Secretary of the Treasury to cover the increased U.S. subscription to the Bank.

This law was added to the U.S. Code on October 1, 1988, as a part of Public Law 100-461, Title V, Section 555. The law is based on Section 1 of H.R. 4645, reported on September 28, 1988, and enacted into law by the same Public Law. 

In simpler terms, this law allows the U.S. to increase its financial contribution to the Bank, thus increasing its share and influence in the institution. The specific amount to be appropriated for this purpose is specified in the law. The subscription to additional shares, however, is subject to the provisions of other legislation that governs the federal budget.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–1l -  Quota increase to 8,608,500,000 Special Drawing Rights 


This section of the U.S. Code allows the U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund to agree to an increase in the U.S.'s quota in the Fund. The increase is capped at 8,608,500,000 Special Drawing Rights, a type of international reserve asset. However, any increase is subject to the amount provided beforehand in appropriations Acts. This law came into effect on October 24, 1992. 

In simpler terms, this law basically says that the U.S. can increase its contribution to the International Monetary Fund, but only up to a specified limit and only if the necessary funds have been approved by Congress through an appropriations Act. This quota system is used to determine a country's financial and organizational commitment to the IMF, as well as its voting power within the organization.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–2 -  Loans to Fund 


The "22 U.S. Code § 286e–2 - Loans to Fund" concerns the Secretary of the Treasury's authorization to make loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to prevent or combat an impairment of the international monetary system. The loans cannot exceed a certain amount of Special Drawing Rights (an international reserve asset created by the IMF) and should be based on the current and prospective balance of payments and reserve position of the United States. 

The code also specifies that the Secretary of the Treasury must certify that supplementary resources are needed and that the Fund has explored other funding means before making the loan. Furthermore, the Secretary must consult with appropriate congressional committees before making any amendments to the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) and must report to Congress on whether additional resources are needed. 

The law also states that the authority to make loans under this code will expire on December 31, 2025. This expiration date can be extended if the Secretary of the Treasury certifies to the appropriate congressional committees 60 days before the expiration date that no amendments will impair the ability to renew the NAB decision and that it is in the United States' strategic economic interest to maintain or lower the U.S. contribution to the NAB. 

Lastly, any payments made to the U.S. by the IMF as repayment on the principal of a loan can continue to be available for loans to the IMF, unless rescinded by an Act of Congress. Interest and charges to the U.S. on the loan will be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

                        Notes

Any purchases of currencies or gold by the United States from the International Monetary Fund may be transferred to and administered by the fund established by section 5302 of title 31, for use in accordance with the provisions of that section. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to utilize the resources of that fund for the purpose of any repayments in connection with such transactions.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–3 -  Transfers to stabilization fund of purchase of currencies or gold from International Monetary Fund; administration; utilization of fund resources for repayments 


This section of the U.S. Code allows for any currencies or gold purchased by the United States from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be transferred to and managed by the fund established by section 5302 of title 31. The Secretary of the Treasury is thus authorized to use the resources of this fund for any repayments related to these transactions. 

The specific fund referred to, established by section 5302 of title 31, is also known as the stabilization fund. This fund is essentially a reserve that the U.S. can use to stabilize its currency or for financial emergencies. 

This code was added in 1962, and it allows for greater financial flexibility for the U.S. government in its dealings with the IMF, providing a mechanism through which it can manage and repay any purchases it makes. The reference to the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 is because this was the original legislation that set up the stabilization fund; however, it has since been codified under title 31 of the U.S. Code.

The loaned funds would be used for the International Finance Corporation's lending operations. This law was added to the U.S. Code in August 1965.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–7 -  Supplementary Financing Facility 


This U.S. Code section authorizes the Treasury Secretary to participate in the Supplementary Financing Facility (SFF), established by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The law allows the Secretary to allocate resources up to the equivalent of 1,450 million Special Drawing Rights (SDR), a type of international monetary reserve currency used by the IMF. 

This code also stipulates that any value adjustments in the U.S.'s monetary assets related to its participation in the SFF must be accounted for through a specific Treasury fund. Authorization for this agreement depends on appropriations approved in advance, and from October 1, 1978, an amount of dollars equivalent to 1,450 million SDR could be appropriated without fiscal year limitation.

In simpler terms, this law gives the Treasury Secretary the power to participate in a special international funding facility, providing up to a certain amount of resources. Any changes in the value of U.S. assets related to this participation have to be accounted for in a specific way. The money for this participation has to be approved in advance and can't exceed a certain amount. The law was enacted in 1978 and has had some updates since then.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–9 -  Stabilization programs 


This section of the U.S. Code instructs the U.S. representative on the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to encourage the IMF to develop stabilization programs that promote investment, employment, and activities that fulfill basic human needs. These programs should be especially focused on countries that have received loans from the IMF. 

The law was first enacted in 1945 and has been amended several times since then. One amendment in 1980 removed specific references to loans from the Supplementary Financing Facility, and another amendment in 1989 removed a requirement for the U.S. Governor of the IMF to submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the impact of the IMF's programs on borrowing countries. 

In simple terms, this law is about making sure the IMF's lending programs do more than just stabilize economies - they should also help improve people's lives. It reflects a belief that international financial assistance should be about more than just dollars and cents, and should also address social and economic inequality.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286e–13 -  Approval of fund pledge to sell gold to provide resources for Reserve Account of Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust 


This section of the U.S. Code grants the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to allow the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to approve the sale of up to 3,000,000 ounces of the Fund's gold. This would only be done if necessary to replenish the resources of the Reserve Account of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Trust. This Trust is used to meet obligations to lenders who have loaned money to the Loan Account of the Trust. These loans are then used to finance programs for IMF member countries that have previously been in arrears to the Fund.

This law was added to the U.S. Code on October 24, 1992, under Public Law 102-511. 

In a nutshell, this law permits the U.S. to approve the IMF selling its gold to meet the obligations of a specific Trust used to aid countries in financial arrears.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286f -  Obtaining and furnishing information to the Fund 


This section of the U.S. Code, specifically titled "22 U.S. Code § 286f -  Obtaining and furnishing information to the Fund", lays out the process for the U.S. government to provide data to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

This includes the President's power to obtain necessary information from any person or entity to comply with the IMF's requests. Failure to comply with such a request could result in a subpoena, and further refusal could be punishable by court.

Furthermore, unlawful disclosure of this information (outside of official duty) or personal benefit from it is considered illegal, punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both. 

The term "person" in this context refers to individuals, partnerships, corporations, or associations.

The section also provides information on Executive Orders related to statistical information provision to intergovernmental organizations, the role of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies, and the various government agencies authorized to collect the necessary information. 

This is all done to ensure that the United States can meet its obligations as a member of the IMF.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286g -  Jurisdiction and venue of actions 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next






For the purpose of any action which may be brought within the United States or its Territories or possessions by or against the Fund or the Bank in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the Fund or the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, the Fund or the Bank, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be an inhabitant of the Federal judicial district in which its principal office in the United States is located, and any such action at law or in equity to which either the Fund or the Bank shall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States, and the district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of any such action. When either the Fund or the Bank is a defendant in any such action, it may, at any time before the trial thereof, remove such action from a State court into the district court of the United States for the proper district by following the procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 10, 59 Stat. 516.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286g -  Jurisdiction and venue of actions 


This section of the U.S. Code stipulates that for any legal action brought within the United States, its territories or possessions by or against the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), these entities will be considered as residents of the federal judicial district where their main U.S. office is located. 

Any legal action involving the IMF or the IBRD will be treated as arising under U.S. laws, and U.S. district courts will have original jurisdiction over such actions. If the IMF or the IBRD is a defendant in any such action, they can opt to move the case from a State court to the corresponding U.S. district court before the start of the trial. 

This piece of legislation was enacted on July 31, 1945. The IMF and the IBRD are significant actors in the global financial system, with the IMF focusing on international monetary cooperation and the IBRD being a component of the World Bank Group which provides loans for development projects in middle-income and low-income countries.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286i -  Stabilization loans by Bank; amendment to Articles of Agreement 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next






The governor and executive director of the Bank appointed by the United States are directed to obtain promptly an official interpretation by the Bank as to its authority to make or guarantee loans for programs of economic reconstruction and the reconstruction of monetary systems, including long-term stabilization loans. If the Bank does not interpret its powers to include the making or guaranteeing of such loans, the governor of the Bank representing the United States is directed to propose promptly and support an amendment to the Articles of Agreement for the purpose of explicitly authorizing the Bank, after consultation with the Fund, to make or guarantee such loans. The President is authorized and directed to accept an amendment to that effect on behalf of the United States.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 12, 59 Stat. 516.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286i -  Stabilization loans by Bank; amendment to Articles of Agreement 


This section of the U.S. Code instructs the U.S. representatives to the International Monetary Fund to seek clarification on whether the IMF has the authority to make or back loans for economic reconstruction and monetary system rebuilding, including long-term stabilization loans. If it is interpreted that the IMF does not hold this power, the U.S. governor of the IMF is instructed to propose and support an amendment to the IMF's Articles of Agreement to explicitly grant the IMF this authority, following consultation with the Fund. The U.S. President is then given the authority to accept such an amendment on behalf of the United States. This provision was enacted on July 31, 1945.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286j -  Use of Fund resources 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next





(a) Official interpretation of authority of Fund

The governor and executive director of the Fund appointed by the United States are directed to obtain promptly an official interpretation by the Fund as to whether its authority to use its resources extends beyond current monetary stabilization operations to afford temporary assistance to members in connection with seasonal, cyclical, and emergency fluctuations in the balance of payment of any member for current transactions, and whether it has authority to use its resources to provide facilities for relief, reconstruction, or armaments, or to meet a large or sustained outflow of capital on the part of any member.


(b) Proposal of amendment

If the interpretation by the Fund answers in the affirmative any of the questions stated in subsection (a), the governor of the Fund representing the United States is directed to propose promptly and support an amendment to the Articles of Agreement for the purpose of expressly negativing such interpretation. The President is authorized and directed to accept an amendment to that effect on behalf of the United States.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 13, 59 Stat. 517.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286j -  Use of Fund resources 


This section of the U.S. Code pertains to the use of resources maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a global organization aimed at fostering monetary cooperation and stability. 

Subsection (a) instructs U.S. representatives within the IMF to seek an official interpretation about the extent of the IMF's authority. Specifically, they are ordered to ascertain whether the IMF has the ability to extend its resources beyond typical monetary stabilization efforts to assist members with temporary issues related to seasonal, cyclical, and emergency fluctuations in their balance of payments. They are also tasked with determining whether the IMF can use its resources for relief, reconstruction, armaments, or to address significant or continuous capital outflows from any member nation.

Subsection (b) mandates that, if the IMF's interpretation affirms any of the above uses of its resources, the U.S. representative must propose and support an amendment to the IMF's Articles of Agreement that expressly negates such interpretation. The President is then authorized and required to accept an amendment to that effect on behalf of the United States.

In simpler terms, this statute seeks to clarify and potentially limit the scope of the IMF's authority, particularly in relation to using its resources for purposes other than monetary stabilization. If the IMF asserts broader authority, U.S. officials are tasked with proposing changes to the IMF's governing documents to expressly deny such extended authority. The President is then obligated to endorse these changes.

(a) Congressional declaration of policy

In the realization that additional measures of international economic cooperation are necessary to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and render most effective the operations of the Fund and the Bank, it is declared to be the policy of the United States to seek to bring about further agreement and cooperation among nations and international bodies, as soon as possible, on ways and means which will best reduce obstacles to and restrictions upon international trade, eliminate unfair trade practices, promote mutually advantageous commercial relations, and otherwise facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and promote the stability of international economic relations. In considering the policies of the United States in foreign lending and the policies of the Fund and the Bank, particularly in conducting exchange transactions, the Council and the United States representatives on the Fund and the Bank shall give careful consideration to the progress which has been made in achieving such agreement and cooperation.


(b) Transmittal of information to Congressional committees

The President shall, upon the request of any committee of the Congress with legislative or oversight jurisdiction over monetary policy or the International Monetary Fund, provide to such committee any appropriate information relevant to that committee’s jurisdiction which is furnished to any department or agency of the United States by the International Monetary Fund. The President shall comply with this provision consistent with United States membership obligations in the International Monetary Fund and subject to such limitations as are appropriate to the sensitive nature of the information.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286k -  Further promotion of international economic relations 


This U.S. Code, also known as the "Further promotion of international economic relations" law, expresses the U.S. government's commitment to fostering international economic cooperation. This commitment includes efforts to reduce obstacles to international trade, eliminate unfair trade practices, and promote stable international economic relations. 

In Section A, the law directs the U.S. Council and its representatives in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to consider the progress made in achieving international agreement and cooperation when developing U.S. foreign lending policies.

In Section B, the law obliges the President to provide relevant information to any Congressional committee that requests it, provided that the information pertains to the committee’s jurisdiction and originates from the IMF. This provision is to be complied with keeping in mind U.S. obligations as an IMF member and the sensitive nature of the information.

This law was last amended in 1977, when it was divided into two sections. The amendment also added the requirement for the President to provide information to Congressional committees. 

In summary, this law emphasizes the U.S.'s commitment to facilitating international trade and economic stability. It also ensures Congressional committees can access relevant information from the IMF to conduct effective oversight of U.S. monetary policy.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286k–2 -  Suspension of right of International Bank to issue securities under section 286k–1; report of Securities and Exchange Commission 


This section of the U.S. Code gives the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems, the authority to suspend the ability of the International Bank to issue or guarantee securities under specific circumstances. The SEC is also required to include in its annual reports to Congress information about the operations and effect of this section, as well as any views submitted by registered dealer associations.

In simpler terms, this legislation gives the SEC power to control when and how the International Bank can issue securities. It's a check and balance mechanism to ensure the International Bank's actions don't negatively impact the overall financial stability.

The reference to "any association of dealers registered with the Commission" suggests that the views of industry insiders, such as brokers and traders, should be considered in these reports. This could help ensure that the regulations are not overly burdensome and remain practical.

One significant executive document related to this section is the Executive Order No. 11269, issued in 1966, which delegates the functions of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.

Financial Agreement Between the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom
It is hereby agreed between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as follows:
1. Effective date of the agreement: The effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which the Government of the United States notifies the Government of the United Kingdom that the Congress of the United States has made available the funds necessary to extend to the Government of the United Kingdom the line of credit in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
2. Line of credit: The Government of the United States will extend to the Government of the United Kingdom a line of credit of $3,750,000,000 which may be drawn upon at any time between the effective date of this Agreement and December 31, 1951, inclusive.
3. Purpose of the line of credit: The purpose of the line of credit is to facilitate purchases by the United Kingdom of goods and services in the United States, to assist the United Kingdom to meet transitional post-war deficits in its current balance of payments, to help the United Kingdom to maintain adequate reserves of gold and dollars, and to assist the Government of the United Kingdom to assume the obligations of multilateral trade, as defined in this and other agreements.
4. Amortization and interest:
(i) The amount of the line of credit drawn by December 31, 1951, shall be repaid in 50 annual installments beginning on December 31, 1951, with interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum. Interest for the year 1951 shall be computed on the amount outstanding on December 31, 1951, and for each year thereafter, interest shall be computed on the amount outstanding on January 1 of each such year.
Forty-nine annual installments of principal repayments and interest shall be equal, calculated at the rate of $31,823,000 for each $1,000,000,000 of the line of credit drawn by December 31, 1951, and the fiftieth installment shall be at the rate of $31,840,736.65 for each such $1,000,000,000. Each installment shall consist of the full amount of the interest due and the remainder of the installment shall be the principal to be repaid in that year. Payments required by this section are subject to the provisions of section 5.
(ii) The Government of the United Kingdom may accelerate repayment of the amount drawn under this line of credit.
5. Deferment of annual installments.
(i) In any calendar year after December 31, 1956, in which the Government of the United Kingdom advises the Government of the United States that it finds that a deferment is necessary in view of the present and prospective conditions of international exchange and the level of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, the Government of the United Kingdom may defer the payment of the annual installment for that year of principal repayment and interest specified under Section 4. Not more than seven (7) annual installments may be so deferred. The first of any such deferred installments shall be paid on December 31, 2001, and the others shall be paid annually thereafter, in order.
(ii) In addition, the installment of interest in respect of the year 1956 is hereby deferred, in lieu of any right of waiver hitherto existing. This installment shall be paid on December 31 of the year following that in which the last of all other installments, including installments deferred under the preceding paragraph, is due.
(iii) Deferred installments shall bear interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum, payable annually on December 31 of each year following that in which deferment occurs.
(iv) Payment of deferred installments may be accelerated, in whole or in part, at the option of the Government of the United Kingdom. [Amended Mar. 6, 1957, eff. Apr. 25, 1957.]
6. Relation of this line of credit to other obligations. The Government of the United Kingdom undertakes not to defer an installment under Section 5 of this Agreement in any year, unless it also defers the installment due in that year under the Financial Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom, dated March 6, 1946. [Amended Mar. 6, 1957, eff. Apr. 25, 1957.]
7. Sterling area exchange arrangements: The Government of the United Kingdom will complete arrangements as early as practicable and in any case not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, under which immediately after the completion of such arrangements the sterling receipts from current transactions of all sterling area countries (apart from any receipts arising out of military expenditure by the Government of the United Kingdom prior to December 31, 1948, to the extent to which they are treated by agreement with the countries concerned on the same basis as the balances accumulated during the war) will be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination; with the result that any discrimination arising from the so-called sterling area dollar pool will be entirely removed and that each member of the sterling area will have its current sterling and dollar receipts at its free disposition for current transactions anywhere.
8. Other exchange arrangements:
(i) Government of the United Kingdom agrees that after the effective date of this Agreement it will not apply exchange controls in such a manner as to restrict (a) payments or transfers in respect of products of the United States permitted to be imported into the United Kingdom or other current transactions between the two countries or (b) the use of sterling balances to the credit of residents of the United States arising out of current transactions. Nothing in this paragraph (i) shall affect the provisions of Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund when those Articles have come into force.
(ii) The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom agree that not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, they will impose no restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions. The obligations of this paragraph (ii) shall not apply:
(a) to balances of third countries and their nationals accumulated before this paragraph (ii) becomes effective; or
(b) to restrictions imposed in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, provided that the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States will not continue to invoke the provisions of Article XIV, Section 2 of those Articles after this paragraph (ii) becomes effective, unless in exceptional cases after consultation they agree otherwise; or
(c) to restrictions imposed in connection with measures designed to uncover and dispose of assets of Germany and Japan.
(iii) This section and section 9, which are in anticipation of more comprehensive arrangements by multilateral agreement, shall operate until December 31, 1951.
9. Import arrangements: If either the Government of the United States or the Government of the United Kingdom imposes or maintains quantitative import restrictions, such restrictions shall be administered on a basis which does not discriminate against imports from the other country in respect of any product; provided that this undertaking shall not apply in cases in which (a) its application would have the effect of preventing the country imposing such restrictions from utilizing, for the purchase of needed imports, inconvertible currencies accumulated up to December 31, 1946, or (b) there may be special necessity for the country imposing such restrictions to assist, by measures not involving a substantial departure from the general rule of non-discrimination, a country whose economy has been disrupted by war, or (c) either government imposes quantitative restrictions having equivalent effect to any exchange restrictions which that government is authorized to impose in conformity with Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. The provisions of this section shall become effective as soon as practicable but not later than December 31, 1946.
10. Accumulated sterling balances:
(i) The Government of the United Kingdom intends to make agreements with the countries concerned, varying according to the circumstances of each case, for an early settlement covering the sterling balances accumulated by sterling area and other countries prior to such settlement (together with any future receipts arising out of military expenditure by the Government of the United Kingdom to the extent to which they are treated on the same basis by agreement with the countries concerned). The settlements with the sterling area countries will be on the basis of dividing these accumulated balances into three categories (a) balances to be released at once and convertible into any currency for current transactions, (b) balances to be similarly released by installments over a period of years beginning in 1951, and (c) balances to be adjusted as a contribution to the settlement of war and postwar indebtedness and in recognition of the benefits which the countries concerned might be expected to gain from such a settlement. The Government of the United Kingdom will make every endeavor to secure the early completion of these arrangements.
(ii) In consideration of the fact that an important purpose of the present line of credit is to promote the development of multilateral trade and facilitate its early resumption on a non-discriminatory basis, the Government of the United Kingdom agrees that any sterling balances released or otherwise available for current payments will, not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement unless in special cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination.
11. Definitions:
For the purposes of this Agreement:
(i) The term “current transactions” shall have the meaning prescribed in Article XIX (i) of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.
(ii) The term “sterling area” means the United Kingdom and the other territories declared by the Defence (Finance) Definition of the Sterling Area) (No. 2) Order, 1944, to be included in the sterling area, namely “the following territories excluding Canada and Newfoundland, that is to say—
(a) any Dominion,
(b) any other part of His Majesty’s dominions,
(c) any territory in respect of which a mandate on behalf of the League of Nations has been accepted by His Majesty and is being exercised by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom or in any Dominion,
(d) any British protectorate or protected State,
(e) Egypt, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Iraq.
(f) Iceland and the Faroe Islands.”
12. Consultation on Agreement: Either government shall be entitled to approach the other for a reconsideration of any of the provisions of this Agreement, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions of international exchange justify such reconsideration, with a view to agreeing upon modifications for presentation to their respective legislatures.
Signed in duplicate at Washington, District of Columbia this 6th day of December, 1945.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286l -  British loan; authorization to Secretary of the Treasury to carry out agreement 


This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems, to carry out an agreement made on December 6, 1945, between the U.S. and the U.K. This agreement, which was presented to Congress by the President on January 30, 1946, was intended to promote international trade and economic stability post-World War II. This code also approves the Secretary of the Treasury's action in signing an amendment to this agreement on March 6, 1957. 

The agreement stipulates that the U.S. government would provide a line of credit of $3,750,000,000 to the U.K., which could be drawn upon at any time until December 31, 1951. This credit line was intended to facilitate the U.K.'s purchases of goods and services from the U.S., assist in meeting post-war balance of payment deficits, maintain adequate gold and dollar reserves, and enable the U.K. to take part in multilateral trade. The agreement also sets out terms for repayment and interest, provides for the possibility of deferment of annual installments, and establishes requirements for exchange arrangements and import arrangements.

For the purpose of carrying out the agreement dated December 6, 1945, between the United States and the United Kingdom, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction not to exceed $3,750,000,000 of the proceeds of any securities issued after July 15, 1946, under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include such purpose. Payments to the United Kingdom under this section and section 286l of this title and pursuant to the agreement and repayments thereof shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. Payments of interest to the United States under the agreement shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286m -  Amount of loan; public-debt transaction; disposition of interest payments 


This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to use up to $3.75 billion from the proceeds of any securities issued after July 15, 1946, under Chapter 31 of Title 31, to carry out an agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. dated December 6, 1945. The uses for which these securities may be issued are expanded to include this purpose. 

Payments to the U.K. under this section, as well as repayments, are treated as public-debt transactions of the U.S. Interest payments to the U.S. under the agreement are to be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 

In simpler terms, this law gave the U.S. government the ability to borrow money through the issuance of securities (like bonds) to fund an agreement with the U.K., with the payments and repayments treated as part of the U.S.'s public debt. The interest earned on these loans would then be added to the U.S. Treasury's general fund. This agreement likely pertained to post-World War II financial arrangements between the two countries.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286n -  Special Drawing Rights 


This code authorizes the President of the United States to accept amendments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement for the establishment of a facility based on Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). SDRs are a supplementary foreign-exchange reserve asset defined and maintained by the IMF. The authority also includes the power to participate in the special drawing account established by the amendment. This law was not part of the original Bretton Woods Agreement Act, which established the IMF and World Bank, but was added later in 1968, as part of the Special Drawing Rights Act. This act was a significant development in international finance, as it signaled an expansion of the resources available to the IMF and its member countries.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286o -  Administration as part of the Exchange Stabilization Fund 


This section of the U.S. Code sets out the administration of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as part of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. SDRs are an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and allocated to its member countries. They can be used by countries to supplement their foreign exchange reserves.

Subsection (a) of this section states that the SDRs allocated to the U.S. will be credited to the account of, and administered as part of, the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which was established to provide the U.S. with financial stability and control over its monetary system.

Subsection (b) outlines the procedures for depositing proceeds from the use of SDRs by the U.S. into the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and for making payments from the Fund for the acquisition of SDRs.

The amendments in 1976 mainly updated the references to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF.

In layman's terms, this section is about how the U.S. manages part of its foreign exchange reserves, and how it interacts with the IMF regarding these reserves.

This section of the U.S. Code pertains to the allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to the United States by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). SDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement its member countries' official reserves.

Key elements include:

1. The President or any representative of the U.S. cannot vote to allocate SDRs to the U.S. in such a way that allocations for a given period exceed the U.S.'s quota in the IMF, unless Congress authorizes such action. 

2. The President or any representative of the U.S. cannot vote to allocate SDRs to the U.S. without the Secretary of the Treasury consulting at least 90 days prior to the vote with key Senate and House committees. 

3. This consultation should include an explanation of how the proposed allocation aligns with the IMF's objectives and the global economic environment. 

The section has been amended multiple times since its enactment in 1968, including changing the reference from "article XXIV" to "article XVIII" in 1976, and specifying that the necessary consultation should occur "at least 90 days prior to any such vote" in 1983.

(a) Formulation and design of programs

The President shall instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and other appropriate Federal officials to use all appropriate means to encourage countries, in formulating economic adjustment programs to deal with their balance of payments difficulties, to design those programs so as to safeguard, to the maximum feasible extent, jobs, investment, real per capita income, policies to reduce the gap in wealth between rich and poor, and social programs such as health, housing, and education.


(b) Changes in Fund guidelines, policies, and decisions; review prior to approval of standby arrangements; coordination among institutions; coordination between Fund and Bank; periodic analysesTo ensure the effectiveness of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources and the reinforcement of those programs by longer term efforts to promote sustained growth and improved living conditions—

(A)
 permit stand-by arrangements to be extended beyond three years, as necessary to enable Fund members to implement their economic adjustment programs successfully;

(B)
 provide that in approving any economic adjustment program the Fund shall take into account the effect such program will have on jobs, investment, real per capita income, the gap in wealth between the rich and poor, and social programs such as health, housing, and education, in order to seek to minimize the adverse impact of those adjustment programs on basic human needs; and

(C)
 provide that letters of intent submitted to the Fund in support of an economic adjustment program reflect that the member country has taken into account the effect such program will have on the factors listed in subparagraph (B);


(2)
(A) before voting on the approval of any standby arrangement with respect to any economic adjustment program, the United States Executive Director shall review—
(i)
 any analysis of factors prepared by the Fund or the member country in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1), or

(B)
 the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall take into account the analysis reviewed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in voting on approval of that standby arrangement;


(3)
 United States representatives to the Fund, to the Bank, and to other appropriate institutions shall work toward improving coordination among these institutions and, in particular, shall work toward formulation of programs in association with economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources which (A) will, among other things, promote employment, investment, real income per capita, improvements in income distribution, and the objectives of social programs such as health, housing, and education, and (B) will, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the borrowing country’s need to improve its balance of payments position within a reasonable period, ameliorate any adverse effects of economic adjustment programs on the poor;

(4) United States representatives to the Fund and the Bank shall seek amendments to decisions on policies on the use of Fund and Bank resources to provide that, where countries are seeking Extended Fund Facility or upper credit tranche drawings from the Fund and are eligible to receive financing from the Bank, the Fund and Bank will coordinate their financing activities in order—
(A)
 to take into account the effects of economic adjustment programs on the areas listed in clause (A) of paragraph (3),

(B)
 to provide, to the extent feasible, Bank project loans designed to safeguard and further basic human needs in countries adopting economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources, and

(C)
 to provide, as appropriate, Bank financing for programs of structural adjustment that will facilitate development of a productive economic base and greater attainment of basic human needs objectives over the longer term; and


(5)
 United States representatives to the Fund and the Bank shall request the Fund and the Bank to provide periodic analyses of the effects of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund or Bank financing on jobs, investment, real income per capita, income distribution, and social programs such as health, housing, and education.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286s -  Consideration of basic human needs in economic adjustment programs supported by Fund 


The 22 U.S. Code § 286s outlines the considerations for basic human needs in economic adjustment programs supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This law instructs federal officials to encourage countries, when designing economic adjustment programs, to consider safeguarding jobs, investments, income, wealth distribution, and social programs such as health, housing, and education.

The law also guides the US representatives at the IMF to recommend changes in the fund's guidelines and policies to consider the effects of such programs on jobs, income, wealth gap, and social programs. Furthermore, they are instructed to coordinate with other institutions, including the World Bank, to ensure programs promote employment, income, and social objectives, and to ameliorate any adverse effects on the poor.

The law finally requires the US representatives to the IMF and the World Bank to request periodic analyses of the effects of these economic adjustment programs on jobs, income, wealth distribution, and social programs. 

The law was added in 1980 and was slightly amended in 1989, removing a subsection that required an annual report to Congress detailing progress made in carrying out the requirements of the law.

L. 96–389, § 4(a), Oct. 7, 1980, 94 Stat. 1553, provided that: “It is the sense of the Congress that (1) the interests of the United States and those of other member countries require an effective International Monetary Fund equipped with resources adequate to facilitate orderly balance-of-payments adjustments; (2) persistent balance-of-payments surpluses in oil exporting countries have placed, and will continue to place, severe strains on the resources of oil importing countries and on the liquidity of the Fund; (3) these strains can only be relieved if the oil exporting countries assume a greater burden for financing balance-of-payments deficits through direct methods of recycling their surpluses and through proportionally greater contributions to the Fund and to the international lending institutions; and (4) the Fund must explore innovative proposals to encourage more direct recycling of oil surpluses and to increase its own liquidity.”









### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286t -  Omitted 


This section of the U.S. Code, which has been omitted, originally called for the Secretary of the Treasury, in cooperation with the United States Director of the Fund, to study and report to Congress on the adequacy of Fund resources, the method of increasing Fund liquidity, the promotion of more direct recycling of oil surpluses, and methods of providing adequate resources for balance-of-payments financing. This was to be completed by May 15, 1981. 

The Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries section discusses the need for an effective International Monetary Fund (IMF) that has adequate resources to facilitate orderly balance-of-payments adjustments. It emphasizes the impact of balance-of-payments surpluses in oil exporting countries on oil importing countries and the liquidity of the IMF. 

The section calls for oil exporting countries to take on a greater financial burden through direct methods of recycling their surpluses and through proportionally greater contributions to the IMF and international lending institutions. Finally, it calls for the IMF to explore innovative proposals to encourage more direct recycling of oil surpluses and increase its own resources. 

No specific events or counterparts are mentioned in this section. Given its omission, it's likely that this provision has been superseded by subsequent legislation or shifts in policy.

It is the policy of the United States that the Palestine Liberation Organization should not be given membership in the Fund or be given observer status or any other official status at any meeting sponsored by or associated with the Fund. The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall promptly notify the Fund of such policy.
In the event that the Fund provides either membership, observer status, or any other official status to the Palestine Liberation Organization, such action would result in a serious diminution of United States support. Upon review of such action, the President would be required to report his recommendations to the Congress with regard to any further United States participation in the Fund.

The U.S. Code 22 § 286w states that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should not be given membership, observer status, or any official status at any meeting sponsored by or associated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). If the IMF were to grant the PLO such status, it would result in a serious drop in U.S. support for the fund. The President would then need to make recommendations to Congress as to whether the U.S. should continue participation in the fund. This law was introduced on October 7, 1980.

(a) In order to help assure that the resources provided under section 286e–1i of this title are used to support pro-growth policies which will help establish the economic conditions necessary for more appropriate financial and exchange rate alignment and stability, it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury shall—
(1)
 in consultation with the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative, initiate discussions with other countries regarding the economic dislocations which result from structural exchange rate imbalances; and

(2)
 instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to work for adoption of policies in the Fund, both within the framework of article IV (of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund) consultations and with respect to the conditions associated with Fund-supported balance of payments adjustments programs, which promote conditions contributing to the stability of exchange rates and avoid the manipulation of exchange rates between major currencies. Among other initiatives, the Secretary of the Treasury shall propose strengthening the article IV consultation procedures of the Fund to attempt to ensure that countries which are artificially maintaining undervalued or overvalued rates of exchange agree to adopt market determined exchange rates.


(b)
 In determining his vote on extensions of assistance to any Fund borrower, the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall take into account whether such borrower’s policies are consistent with the requirements of article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 40, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 801], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1267.)

The U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund is also instructed to advocate for policies that promote exchange rate stability and prevent manipulation of exchange rates between major currencies. The section also provides that considerations should be made on whether a Fund borrower's policies are in line with the requirements of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund when deciding on extensions of assistance. The section was added in November 1983.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286z -  Collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next





(a) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that—
(1)
 the lack of sufficient information currently available to allow members of the Fund to make sound and prudent decisions concerning their public and private sector international borrowing, and to allow lenders to make sound and prudent decisions concerning their international lending, threatens the stability of the international monetary system; and

(2)
 in recognition of the Fund’s duties, as provided particularly by article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, to act as a center for the collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems, the Fund should adopt necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that more complete and timely financial information will be available.


(b) Initiation by United States Executive Director of discussions with other Directors; adoption of proceduresTo this end, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to initiate discussions with other directors of the Fund and with Fund management, and to propose and vote for, the adoption of procedures, within the Fund—
(1) to collect and disseminate information, on a quarterly basis, from and to Fund members, and to such other persons as the Fund deems appropriate, concerning—
(A)
 the extension of credit by banks or nonbanks to private and public entities, including all government entities, instrumentalities, and central banks of member countries; and

(B)
 the receipt of such credit by those private and public entities of member countries, where such banks or nonbanks are not principally established within the borders of the member country to which the credits are extended; and


(2)
 to disseminate publicly information which is developed in the course of the Fund’s collection, and to review and comment on efforts which the Fund determines would serve to enhance the informational base upon which international borrowing and lending decisions are taken.


(c) “Credit” definedFor purposes of this section, the term “credit” includes—
(1)
 outstanding loans to private and public entities, including government entities, instrumentalities, and central banks of any member, and

(2)
 unused lines of credit which have been made available to those private and public entities of any member,

where such loans or lines of credit are repayable in freely convertible currency.

(d) Providing necessary information

The President is authorized to use the authority provided under section 286f of this title to require any person (as defined in such section) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide such information as the Fund determines to be necessary in order to carry out the provisions of this section.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 42, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 802(a)(4)], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1269.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286z -  Collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems 


This section of the U.S. Code, 22 U.S. Code § 286z, pertains to the collection and exchange of information on monetary and financial problems. The Congress asserts that a lack of sufficient information about public and private sector international borrowing and lending threatens the stability of the international monetary system. It urges the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to adopt measures that will ensure more complete and timely financial information is available.

To achieve this goal, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to initiate discussions with other directors of the IMF and propose the adoption of procedures within the IMF to collect and disseminate information about the extension and receipt of credit by banks or non-banks to private and public entities, including governments and central banks of member countries. This information should be made public and the IMF should review and comment on efforts aimed at enhancing the informational base for international borrowing and lending decisions.

The term "credit" in this context refers to outstanding loans and unused lines of credit repayable in freely convertible currency. The President is empowered to require any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to provide necessary information to the IMF.

This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1983 as a part of the broader legislation passed on July 31, 1945 (ch. 339, § 42, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 802(a)(4)], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat.). It reflects a policy approach aimed at increasing transparency and information sharing in international financial markets to better manage risks and maintain stability.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286aa -  Instructions to United States Executive Director; Communist dictatorships

                        Notes 




prev | next





The Congress hereby finds that Communist dictatorships result in severe constraints on labor and capital mobility and other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities which contribute to balance of payments deficits in direct contradiction of the goals of the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to actively oppose any facility involving use of Fund credit by any Communist dictatorship, unless the Secretary of the Treasury certifies and documents in writing upon request and so notifies and appears, if requested, before the Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committees of the Senate and the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, at least twenty-one days in advance of any vote on such drawing that such drawing—
(1)
 provides the basis for correcting the balance of payments difficulties and restoring a sustainable balance of payments position;

(2)
 would reduce the severe constraints on labor and capital mobility or other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities and advances market-oriented forces in that country; and

(3)
 is in the best economic interest of the majority of the people in that country.

Should the Secretary not meet a request to appear before the aforementioned committees at least twenty-one days in advance of any vote on any facility involving use of Fund credit by any communist dictatorship and certify and document in writing that these three conditions have been met, the United States Executive Director shall vote against such program.
(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 43, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 804], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1270; amended Pub. L. 103–149, § 4(b)(6), Nov. 23, 1993, 107 Stat. 1505.)

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286aa -  Instructions to United States Executive Director; Communist dictatorships 


This law, enacted in 1983 and amended in 1993, is about how the U.S. conducts financial dealings with Communist dictatorships through the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The law states that the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF is instructed by the Secretary of the Treasury to oppose any financial assistance to any Communist dictatorship unless it meets certain conditions.

These conditions are: 
1. The financial assistance must provide a basis for correcting the balance of payments difficulties and restore a sustainable balance of payments position.
2. The financial assistance must reduce the constraints on labor and capital mobility or other inefficiencies in labor and capital supply, and promote market-oriented forces in that country.
3. The financial assistance must be in the best economic interest of the majority of the people in that country.

If these conditions aren't met, and if the Secretary of the Treasury doesn't appear before certain Senate and House Committees to certify in writing that these conditions have been met, then the U.S. Executive Director is required to vote against such financial assistance.

The 1993 amendment to the law removed a provision that related to countries practicing apartheid. 

As for its historical context, it's worth noting that this law was enacted during the Cold War, a period marked by ideological battles between the U.S. and Communist regimes. This law can be seen as an attempt to use economic influence as a tool to promote democratic and market-oriented values in Communist nations.

(a) Economic adjustment programs
(1)
 The President shall instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and other appropriate Federal officials, and shall request the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to use all appropriate means to encourage countries to formulate economic adjustment programs to deal with their balance of payment difficulties and external debt owed to private banks.

(2)
 Such economic adjustment programs should be designed to safeguard, to the maximum extent feasible, international economic growth, world trade, employment, and the long-term solvency of banks, and to minimize the likelihood of civil disturbances in countries needing economic adjustment programs.


(b) Changes in Fund guidelines; limitations on debt service exceptionsTo ensure the effectiveness of economic adjustment programs supported by Fund resources—
(1) the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall recommend and shall work for changes in Fund guidelines, policies, and decisions which would—
(A)
 convert short-term bank debt which was made at high interest rates into long-term debt at lower rates of interest;

(B)
 assure that the annual external debt service, which shall include principal, interest, points, fees, and other charges required of the country involved, is a manageable and prudent percentage of the projected annual export earnings of such country; and

(C)
 provide that in approving any economic adjustment program the Fund shall take into account the number of countries applying to the Fund for economic adjustment programs and the aggregate effects that such programs will have on international economic growth, world trade, exports and employment of other member countries, and the long-term solvency of banks; and


(2) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the United States Executive Director of the Fund shall oppose and vote against providing assistance from the Fund for any economic adjustment program for a country in which the annual external debt service exceeds 85 per centum of the annual export earnings of such country, unless the Secretary of the Treasury first determines and provides written documentation to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives that—
(A)
 the economic adjustment program converts high interest rate, short-term bank debt into long-term debt at significantly narrower interest rate spreads than the average interest rate spreads prevailing on bank debt reschedulings negotiated between August 1982 and August 1983 for countries receiving assistance from the Fund for economic adjustment programs in order to minimize the burdens of adjustment on the debtor nation, provided that such interest rate spreads are consistent with that nation’s need to obtain adequate external private financing;

(B)
 the annual external debt service required of the country involved is a manageable and prudent percentage of the projected annual export earnings of such country; and

(C)
 the economic adjustment program will not have an adverse impact on international economic growth, world trade, exports, and employment of other member countries, and the long-term solvency of banks.



(c) Emergencies and extraordinary circumstancesThe provisions of subsection (b)(2) shall not apply in any case in which the Secretary of the Treasury first determines and provides written documentation to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives that—
(1)
 an emergency exists in a nation that has applied to the Fund for assistance that requires an immediate short-term loan to avoid disrupting orderly financial markets;

(2)
 a sudden decrease in export earnings in the country applying to the Fund for assistance has increased the ratio of annual external debt service to annual export earnings, to greater than 85 per centum for a period projected to be no more than one year; or

(3)
 other extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant waiving the provisions of subsection (b)(2).

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286cc -  Sustaining economic growth 


This section of the U.S. Code, added in 1983, outlines the responsibilities of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, other Federal officials, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System in encouraging countries to formulate economic adjustment programs. These programs are meant to address balance of payment difficulties and external debt owed to private banks, safeguard international economic growth, world trade, employment, and the long-term solvency of banks, and minimize the likelihood of civil disturbances.

The U.S. Executive Director of the Fund is tasked with recommending changes in Fund guidelines, policies, and decisions, converting short-term high-interest bank debt into long-term debt at lower rates, assuring that annual external debt service is manageable and prudent, and considering the aggregate effects of such programs on international economic growth and other factors.

The section also stipulates that the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund should oppose providing assistance for any economic adjustment program where the annual external debt service exceeds 85 percent of the annual export earnings of the country in question, unless certain conditions are met. Exceptions are allowed in cases of emergencies and extraordinary circumstances.

This law is essentially aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth in countries facing economic challenges, by providing guidelines for debt management and economic stabilization efforts.

(1)
 to oppose and vote against any Fund drawing by a member country where, in his judgment, the Fund resources would be drawn principally for the purpose of repaying loans which have been imprudently made by banking institutions to the member country; and

This section of the U.S. code mandates the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to:

1. Oppose and vote against any IMF lending to a member country if the funds would be primarily used to pay back loans that were recklessly given by banks to that country. The goal is to prevent imprudent banking practices and discourage financial recklessness.

2. Encourage countries borrowing from the IMF and their banking institutions to renegotiate their debt repayment schedules when necessary. This should be done in line with sound banking practices and the borrowing country's ability to repay the debt.

This law was enacted on November 30, 1983, as part of Public Law 98-181. It aims to ensure responsible lending and borrowing behavior among IMF member countries and banking institutions.

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to propose and work for the adoption of Fund policies regarding the rate of remuneration paid on use of member’s quota subscriptions and the rate of charges on Fund drawings to bring those rates in line with market rates.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 48, as added Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title VIII, § 810], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1274.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286ff -  Fund interest rates 


This section of the U.S. Code mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to guide the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to propose and encourage the adoption of policies that align the rate of remuneration for the use of member countries' quota subscriptions and the rate of charges on IMF loans with prevailing market rates. This law was added on November 30, 1983. 

In simpler terms, this law is intended to ensure that the costs and benefits associated with the use of member's quota subscriptions and the charges on loans from the IMF are comparable to those found in the broader financial markets. The quota subscription is the amount of money each IMF member country must contribute as part of their membership; it also determines their voting power within the organization. The remuneration is the interest paid by the IMF on this quota. The charges on the fund drawings refer to the interest rate the IMF charges on its loans.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286gg -  Elimination of trade restrictions 


This U.S. Code section pertains to the elimination of trade restrictions. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to initiate wide consultations with the U.S. Executive Director of multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to develop financial assistance policies that reduce international trade and investment obstacles, eliminate unfair practices, and promote mutually beneficial economic relations. 

The Secretary is also instructed to work with the Trade Policy Committee and encourage cooperation with the World Trade Organization (WTO). 

Before extending financial assistance to a country through these banks or the IMF, the Secretary is tasked with working to have the country agree to eliminate unfair trade and investment practices. This includes practices such as providing predatory export subsidies, imposing unreasonable import restrictions, and any practices inconsistent with international agreements.

For determining the U.S. position on loan requests, the Secretary is instructed to consider the progress countries have made in eliminating or phasing out unfair practices. If the U.S. supports a loan request by a country that hasn't achieved the targets, the Secretary must report to Congress the reasons for this position.

The term "multilateral development banks" is defined to include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

The code has been amended several times, most notably in 1986 to include language pertaining to "multilateral development banks" and in 1999 to replace references to the "GATT Secretariat" with the "Secretariat of the World Trade Organization".

(a) CriteriaThe Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to advocate and support the facilitation of voluntary market-based programs for the reduction of sovereign debt and the promotion of sustainable economic development, which, if implemented, would—

 not require any organization or government to participate in such a program;

(2)
 result in debt reduction for each participating country tailored to the particular situation of each country;

(3)

(4)
 encourage participating countries to make economic adjustments steadily and over a period of time in order to achieve policy reform;

(5)
 use debt reduction techniques that would not compensate commercial banks for the reduction in the value of such debt, but would serve as a catalyst for new lending;

(6)
 involve such bank in lending for purposes of debt reduction and conversion only where such involvement would not lower the credit-worthiness of such bank;

(7)
 not require public sector funding beyond that provided through any capital increase for such bank, and any replenishment for the International Development Association, which is agreed to by the member countries of such institutions; and

(8)
 accomplish debt reduction, not as an end, but as a means to greater growth and investment in, and the restoration of voluntary private lending to, participating countries for environmentally and economically sustainable development.


(b) Policy based lending for debt reduction and sustainable growth

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to propose that policy based loans be made by such bank for, among other reasons, facilitating a reduction in the debt service burden of any country which is participating in a voluntary market-based program for debt reduction described in subsection (c).

(2)
 contains an explanation of the measures taken by such bank to facilitate the reduction of the debt burden of the countries designated as “Highly Indebted Countries” in the 1987–1988 World Debt tables [1] published by such bank;

(3)
 describes the extent (if any) to which such bank has implemented the measures described in subsections (b) and (c); and

(4)
 describes the success each of such countries has had in managing and reducing their debt burdens and achieving sustainable and equitable economic growth as measured by criteria including the ratio of debt service to exports, the ratio of debt to gross national product, net resource flows, and per capita income.


(e) Review by House Banking Committee

On receipt of each report required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (d), and after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives shall forward such report to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives with an assessment by the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs describing the effect on the international debt situation of funding the subscription of the United States to the shares of capital stock of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development due for payment by the United States in the then next fiscal year.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286hh -  Policy based lending for debt reduction 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines a policy for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to aid in sovereign debt reduction and sustainable economic development in participating countries. This policy would be voluntary, tailored to the specific needs of each country, and would require the implementation and preservation of economic reforms consistent with sustainable development. 

The policy also advocates for debt reduction techniques that would not compensate commercial banks for their losses, but would encourage new lending. The International Bank's involvement in debt reduction would be limited to ensure it does not compromise its own credit-worthiness. 

Reports detailing the success of this policy are to be submitted to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. These reports will detail the strategy, lending programs, measures taken, and success rates of the debt reduction efforts. 

The section concludes by noting that the term 'credit rating' was changed to 'credit-worthiness' in a 2010 amendment.

(2)
 instruct the United States Executive Director of such bank to propose and actively seek the adoption by the board of Executive Directors of such bank of a resolution establishing as official bank operating policy for fiscal years 1990 through 1995 of such bank the limits specified in paragraph (1); and

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286ii -  Limitations on Bank policy based lending; actions required to be taken to oppose excessive policy based lending by Bank 


This section of the U.S. Code mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to encourage the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, often known as the World Bank) to limit the value of its policy-based loans. These loans - which are generally provided to support a country's policy and institutional reforms - shouldn't exceed 25% of the total value of loans made by the bank in any fiscal year, and shouldn't exceed 50% of the total value of loans made to a specific country over a three-year period. The Secretary is also required to guide the U.S. executive director of the bank to propose and seek the adoption of this policy. The resolution hasn't yet been adopted, the Secretary must consult with the Secretary of State to secure the consent and cooperation of other member governments for the adoption of these limits. 

The provision, which became law in 1988, was aimed at controlling the World Bank's lending activities and ensuring fiscal responsibility. It was not part of the original Bretton Woods Agreements Act, which established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

##  22 U.S. Code § 286jj -  Partial guarantees in connection with debt reduction for borrower countries

The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with other directors of such bank and to propose that such bank establish criteria under which such bank would provide partial guarantees on debt service payments by borrower countries to private creditors when such guarantees would serve a catalytic role in facilitating final agreement on financing packages which involve significant debt reduction.

This is meant to help facilitate final agreements on financial packages that involve significant debt reduction. 

The idea is that if a country is struggling to repay its debts, the World Bank could step in and guarantee a portion of the debt service payments. This could make it easier for the country to negotiate new repayment terms with its creditors, since the creditors would have greater assurance of getting their money back. This legislation is not part of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 1945, which established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286kk -  Discussions to enhance capacity of Fund to alleviate potentially adverse impacts of Fund programs on poor and environment 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next





The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to seek policy changes by the Fund, through formal initiatives and through bilateral discussions, which will result in—
(1)
 the initiation of a systematic review of policy prescriptions implemented by the Fund, for the purpose of determining whether the Fund’s objectives were met and the social and environmental impacts of such policy prescriptions; and

(2)
 the establishment of procedures which ensure the inclusion, in future economic reform programs approved by the Fund, of policy options which eliminate or reduce the potential adverse impact on the well-being of the poor or the environment resulting from such programs.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 55, as added Pub. L. 101–240, title III, § 302, Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2500.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286kk -  Discussions to enhance capacity of Fund to alleviate potentially adverse impacts of Fund programs on poor and environment 


This U.S. law mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to guide the U.S. representative (the Executive Director) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF or the Fund) to encourage the Fund to make policy changes. These changes are intended to have two key outcomes: 

1) To carry out a systematic review of the Fund's policy implementations to determine if its objectives were achieved and to assess the social and environmental impacts of its policies, 

2) To establish procedures that will ensure future economic reform programs approved by the Fund consider policy options that can mitigate any potential negative effects on the poor or the environment.

In simpler terms, the law is designed to ensure that the IMF's policies are not just economically sound but also take into consideration their socio-environmental impact, particularly on the poor and the environment. 

For instance, if the IMF had a program that led to economic growth but also caused environmental degradation, this law would encourage the Fund to rethink such a policy and find alternatives that would still promote growth but without the environmental harm. 

This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1989, indicating a growing awareness and concern at that time about the social and environmental impacts of global economic policies.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286ll -  Fund policy changes 


This section of the U.S. Code pertains to the U.S. Treasury Secretary’s instructions to the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Executive Director is to regularly advocate for certain policy changes within the IMF, mainly revolving around poverty alleviation and imposition of environmentally sound policies. 

Specifically, considerations of poverty alleviation and reduction of barriers to economic and social progress should be included in all IMF programs. The policy framework papers should detail the poverty, economic, and social measures that the borrowing nation needs to address. The IMF should also consider the commitment of the borrower to address these issues before allocating resources. 

The IMF is encouraged to incorporate environmental considerations into all Fund programs, including consultations under article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. The IMF should also support the efforts of nations to implement systems of natural resource accounting in their national income accounts.

Furthermore, the IMF should conduct periodical audits to review the policy prescriptions in the areas of poverty and environment, and to determine their impacts. The audits should have access to all ongoing programs and activities of the Fund and should be made public as appropriate, respecting confidentiality.

The IMF should also focus on policy options that increase the involvement of the poor in economic reform programs and ensure public access to information, while maintaining appropriate confidentiality. 

The U.S. Treasury Secretary is also required to urge the IMF to explore ways to increase the involvement and participation of various experts and representatives from the loan-recipient country in the development of IMF programs. 

The National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies must include in its annual report the actions taken by the U.S. Executive Director and the progress of the Fund in implementing these proposals.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286mm -  Measures to reduce military spending by developing nations 


This section of the U.S. Code establishes measures to track and reduce military spending by developing nations. Specifically, it mandates that the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) pushes for the Fund to develop a method to measure military spending by each developing country. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to report to various Congressional committees on the progress of this initiative. 

Additionally, the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund is requested to encourage the Fund to provide annual reports on the estimated level of military spending by each developing country, beginning with 1994. The reports should be presented to the Executive Board of the Fund no later than the date of the annual fall Interim and Development Committee meetings.

Lastly, it instructs the U.S. Executive Director of the Fund to push for the inclusion of an analysis of military spending by each developing country in every Article IV consultation with that country. 

These measures are aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in military spending with the ultimate goal of reducing unnecessary expenditures in countries where resources could be better allocated to development initiatives.

                        Notes 




prev | next





For the purpose of mobilizing the resources of the Fund in order to help reduce poverty and improve the lives of residents of poor countries and, in particular, to allow those poor countries with unsustainable debt burdens to receive deeper, broader, and faster debt relief, without allowing gold to reach the open market or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to vote—
(1) to approve an arrangement whereby the Fund—
(A)
 sells a quantity of its gold at prevailing market prices to a member or members in nonpublic transactions sufficient to generate 2.226 billion Special Drawing Rights in profits on such sales;

(B)
 immediately after, and in conjunction with each such sale, accepts payment by such member or members of such gold to satisfy existing repurchase obligations of such member or members so that the Fund retains ownership of the gold at the conclusion of such payment; and

(C)
 uses the earnings on the investment of the profits of such sales through a separate subaccount, only for the purpose of providing debt relief from the Fund under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative (as defined in section 262p–6 of this title); and


(2)
 to support a decision that shall terminate the Special Contingency Account 2 (SCA–2) of the Fund so that the funds in the SCA–2 shall be made available to the poorest countries. Any funds attributable to the United States participation in SCA–2 shall be used only for debt relief from the Fund under the modified HIPC Initiative.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286nn -  Approval of contributions for debt reductions for the poorest countries 


This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to vote in favor of a scheme allowing the IMF to sell its gold to member states at market prices in order to provide debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries. The gold sales would generate profits, which would then be invested, and the earnings from this investment would also be used for debt relief.

This law also supports the termination of the Special Contingency Account 2 (SCA-2) of the IMF, with the funds in this account being made available to the poorest countries for debt relief. Any funds resulting from the U.S. participation in the SCA-2 are to be used only for debt relief.

An amendment in 2000 removed a limitation on the use of earnings from the investment of the profits from the gold sales.

The law came into being on July 31, 1945, and was amended on November 6, 2000. It was further stipulated that within 15 days of the U.S. Executive Director casting the necessary votes, the Secretary of the Treasury must assure Congress that neither the profits nor the earnings from the investment of profits from the gold sales or the funds attributable to U.S. participation in the SCA-2 will be used to increase the resources of any reserve account of the IMF.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286oo -  Principles for International Monetary Fund lending 







                        U.S. Code 



                        Notes 




prev | next





It is the policy of the United States to work to implement reforms in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to achieve the following goals:
(1) Short-term balance of payments financing

Lending from the general resources of the Fund should concentrate chiefly on short-term balance of payments financing.


(2) Limitations on medium-term financingUse of medium-term lending from the general resources of the Fund should be limited to a set of well-defined circumstances, such as—
(A)
 when a member’s balance of payments problems will be protracted;

(B)
 such member has a strong structural reform program in place; and

(C)
 the member has little or no access to private sources of capital.


(3) Premium pricing

Premium pricing should be introduced for lending from the general resources of the Fund, for greater than 200 percent of a member’s quota in the Fund, to discourage excessive use of Fund lending and to encourage members to rely on private financing to the maximum extent possible.


(4) Redressing misreporting of informationThe Fund should have in place and apply systematically a strong framework of safeguards and measures to respond to, correct, and discourage cases of misreporting of information in the context of a Fund program, including—
(A)
 suspending Fund disbursements and ensuring that Fund lending is not resumed to members that engage in serious misreporting of material information until such time as remedial actions and sanctions, as appropriate, have been applied;

(B)
 ensuring that members make early repayments, where appropriate, of Fund resources disbursed on the basis of misreported information;

(C)
 making public cases of serious misreporting of material information;

(D)
 requiring all members receiving new disbursements from the Fund to undertake annually independent audits of central bank financial statements and publish the resulting audits; and

(E)
 requiring all members seeking new loans from the Fund to provide to the Fund detailed information regarding their internal control procedures, financial reporting and audit mechanisms and, in cases where there are questions about the adequacy of these systems, undertaking an on-site review and identifying needed remedies.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 63, as added Pub. L. 106–429, § 101(a) [title VIII, § 805], Nov. 6, 2000, 114 Stat. 1900, 1900A–67.)

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286oo -  Principles for International Monetary Fund lending 


The U.S. law titled 22 U.S. Code § 286oo outlines the U.S. policy towards reforms in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It contains five key principles. 

Firstly, it suggests that IMF lending should primarily focus on short-term balance of payments financing. 

Secondly, medium-term financing should be limited to specific situations, such as when a member has long-term balance of payments problems, has a robust structural reform program, and has little or no access to private capital sources. 

Thirdly, the law proposes premium pricing for lending beyond 200% of a member's quota in the Fund. This is to deter excessive use of IMF lending and promote reliance on private financing where possible.

Fourth, it urges the IMF to adopt and apply a robust framework to manage and dissuade instances of false reporting of information within a Fund program. This involves suspending disbursements, requiring early repayments, and making public serious misreporting instances. 

Finally, it suggests that members looking for new loans from the Fund should provide detailed information about their internal control procedures, financial reporting mechanisms, and audit systems. If there are doubts about the adequacy of these systems, the Fund should conduct an on-site review and identify necessary remedies.

This law was added to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act on November 6, 2000, under Pub. L. 106–429.

##  22 U.S. Code § 286qq -  Quota increase to 4,973,100,000 Special Drawing Rights 







                        U.S. Code 




prev | next





(a) In general

The United States Governor of the Fund may consent to an increase in the quota of the United States in the Fund equivalent to 4,973,100,000 Special Drawing Rights.


(b) Subject to appropriations

The authority provided by subsection (a) shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriations Acts.


(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 65, as added Pub. L. 111–32, title XIV, § 1402, June 24, 2009, 123 Stat. 1918.)












### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286qq -  Quota increase to 4,973,100,000 Special Drawing Rights 


This U.S. law authorizes the U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to agree to an increase in the U.S.'s quota in the Fund by an equivalent of 4,973,100,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDR). This increase in quota is contingent upon it being provided for in advance in appropriations acts. The law was added in June 2009. 

In simpler terms, this law allows the U.S. to increase its financial commitment to the IMF, which is a global organization that works to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The SDR is an international reserve asset, created by the IMF, that serves as a supplement to the existing official reserves of member countries. The increase in the U.S.'s quota means an increase in the U.S.'s financial contribution to the IMF, and, by extension, its influence within the organization. 

This law is a reflection of the U.S.'s commitment to international monetary cooperation and global financial stability.

(July 31, 1945, ch. 339, § 66, as added Pub. L. 111–32, title XIV, § 1402, June 24, 2009, 123 Stat. 1918.)

This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to vote for the sale of a specific amount of gold owned by the IMF. This sale should only occur if it aligns with certain guidelines designed to prevent disruption to the world gold market.

The Secretary of the Treasury must also ensure that the proceeds from the sale will benefit low-income countries eligible for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility or other low-income lending from the IMF. The funds from the sale are intended to be used to provide loans and debt relief or grants to these countries, with a minimum amount set at $4 billion. The support provided must be sustained for at least two years, and the majority of it should be distributed within the first two years of the six-year period.

In addition to this, the U.S. Governor, in agreement with the amendments referred to, is authorized to take necessary actions to use the proceeds from the gold sale to assist low-income countries. This provision was added to the U.S. Code in June 2009.

### commentary on ##  22 U.S. Code § 286vv -  Capital stock increases 


This section of the U.S. Code authorizes the U.S. Governor of the Bank, presumably the World Bank, to vote for an increase in the Bank's capital stock on both a selective and general basis. The U.S. is also authorized to subscribe to additional shares of the Bank's capital stock as part of these increases. However, such subscriptions are only effective to the extent or in amounts that are provided in advance in appropriations Acts.

This section also stipulates limits on the authorization of appropriations to pay for these increases. There is no fiscal year limitation on the amounts authorized to be appropriated, and payments are to be made by the Secretary of the Treasury. The amounts authorized are earmarked for paid in shares and callable shares of the Bank.

The note at the bottom of the section indicates that there was likely a typographical error in the original text, suggesting that "paragraph (2)(A)" should probably read "paragraph (1)".

In 2013, this section was amended to add paragraphs (3) and (4) to subsection (b), authorizing additional appropriations to pay for further increases in the U.S. subscription to the Bank's capital stock.
