### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 1 -  Repealed. Pub. L. 98–473, title II, § 218(a)(1), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2027] 


The 18 U.S. Code § 1 was repealed on October 12, 1984. It previously categorized offenses as a felony, misdemeanor, or petty offense. The repeal took effect on November 1, 1987, and was applicable only to offenses committed after the repeal took effect.

The code also mentions various amendments made in the following years, including the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act in 2023, the United States Parole Commission Additional Extension Act of 2022, and the 21st Century President Act in 2022, among others.

In a nutshell, while the original section was repealed, it seems the section's space has been utilized to list out new acts and amendments to other sections of the U.S. Code.

(a)
 Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.

(b)
 Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 684; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, § 17b, 65 Stat. 717.)







Historical and Revision Notes
Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 550 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 332, 35 Stat. 1152).
Section 2(a) comprises section 550 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., without change except in minor matters of phraseology.
Section 2(b) is added to permit the deletion from many sections throughout the revision of such phrases as “causes or procures”.
The section as revised makes clear the legislative intent to punish as a principal not only one who directly commits an offense and one who “aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures” another to commit an offense, but also anyone who causes the doing of an act which if done by him directly would render him guilty of an offense against the United States.
It removes all doubt that one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise but causes the commission of an indispensable element of the offense by an innocent agent or instrumentality, is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense.
This accords with the following decisions: Rothenburg v. United States, 1918, 38 S. Ct. 18, 245 U.S. 480, 62 L. Ed. 414, and United States v. Hodorowicz, C. C. A. Ill. 1939, 105 F. 2d 218, certiorari denied, 60 S. Ct. 108, 308 U.S. 584, 84 L. Ed. 489. United States v. Giles, 1937, 57 S. Ct. 340, 300 U.S. 41, 81 L. Ed. 493, rehearing denied, 57 S. Ct. 505, 300 U.S. 687, 81 L. Ed. 888.

Editorial Notes
Amendments
1951—Subsec. (a). Act Oct. 31, 1951, inserted “punishable as”.
Subsec. (b). Act Oct. 31, 1951, inserted “willfully” before “causes”, and “or another” after “him”, and substituted “is punishable as a principal” for “is also a principal and punishable as such”.









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 2 -  Principals 


This section of the U.S. Code, 18 U.S. Code § 2 - Principals, establishes that any individual who commits an offense against the United States, or aids, encourages, or instigates its commission, is punishable as the primary perpetrator. It also states that anyone who knowingly causes an act to be done, which if directly performed by him or someone else would be a crime against the U.S., is also punishable as a principal.

The law adds clarity that those who initiate or participate in an illegal activity, but cause the actual crime to be committed by an unknowing third party, are just as guilty as if they had committed the act themselves. In other words, this law holds all those involved in supporting, organizing, directing, or causing a crime to be committed as equally responsible as the one who carried out the crime.

This law has been amended once in 1951 to clarify the language, including the addition of the word "willfully" before "causes" and the phrase "or another" after "him". The amendment also replaced "is also a principal and punishable" with "is punishable as a principal", making it clearer that such individuals will face prosecution as if they were the primary perpetrators of the crime. 

This law is crucial in cases where the person who physically committed the crime was not the person who planned or orchestrated it. It allows the courts to hold those who masterminded the crime accountable, even if they did not carry out the act themselves.

The first paragraph is new. It is based upon authority of Skelly v. United States (C. C. A. Okl. 1935, 76 F. 2d 483, certiorari denied, 1935, 55 S. Ct. 914, 295 U.S. 757, 79 L. Ed. 1699), where the court defined an accessory after the fact as—
one who knowing a felony to have been committed by another, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon in order to hinder the felon’s apprehension, trial, or punishment—
and cited Jones’ Blackstone, books 3 and 4, page 2204; U.S. v. Hartwell (Fed. Cas. No. 15,318); Albritton v. State (32 Fla. 358, 13 So. 955); State v. Davis (14 R. I. 281); Schleeter v. Commonwealth (218 Ky. 72, 290 S. W. 1075). (See also State v. Potter, 1942, 221 N. C. 153, 19 S. E. 2d 257; Hunter v. State, 1935, 128 Tex. Cr. R. 191, 79 S. W. 2d 855; State v. Wells, 1940, 195 La. 754, 197 So. 419.)

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 3 -  Accessory after the fact 


This section of the U.S. Code defines an "accessory after the fact" as someone who, knowing that a crime has been committed, provides any form of assistance to the offender with the intention of hindering their arrest, trial, or punishment. The punishment for such an individual is set at a maximum of half the imprisonment term or fine prescribed for the primary offender. However, if the primary offense was punishable by life imprisonment or death, the accessory can face up to 15 years in prison. 

Historically, this segment of the U.S. Code was based on the 1940 edition and has seen several amendments over the years. In 1994, a clause was added stipulating that financial penalties could be imposed notwithstanding section 3571 of the U.S. Code. Another amendment in 1994 made retroactive to 1990 increased the maximum imprisonment for an accessory where the main crime carried a life sentence or death penalty from 10 to 15 years. An earlier amendment in 1986 had inserted reference to "life imprisonment" in the code.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 4 -  Misprision of felony 


This federal law, known as Misprision of felony, criminalizes the act of concealing knowledge of a committed felony. According to 18 U.S.C. § 4, anyone who is aware of a felony offense recognized by a U.S. court and does not promptly report it to a judge or other civil or military authority can face penalties. The penalties include a fine, imprisonment for up to three years, or both.

The law was enacted on June 25, 1948, and it was revised on September 13, 1994, by Public Law 103–322. The 1994 amendment updated the language of the law, replacing the phrase "fined not more than" with "fined under this title."

The primary purpose of the law is to ensure that individuals do not enable or contribute to criminal activities by withholding information. It encourages citizens to report observed felonies to the relevant authorities promptly. This encourages active participation in maintaining law and order, and it promotes responsibility and accountability.

Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 39, 133, 346, 381, 502, and 632, and section 40 of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title XIII, § 1, 40 Stat. 231).
Section consolidates the first sentence of section 39, all of sections 133, 346, and 632, and the second sentences, respectively, of sections 381 and 502, all of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 40 of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense, with minor changes in phraseology.
All of these sections and parts of sections were derived from section 1 of title XIII of said act of June 15, 1917. Said section 40 of title 50, U.S.C., War and National Defense, has also been retained in that title, as it still relates to some sections therein which were not transferred to this title.
The remainder of said section 39 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was derived from sections 2, 3, and 4 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, relating to jurisdiction and other matters, is almost entirely obsolete. The provisions still in force are incorporated in section 3241 of this title.
The remaining provisions of said sections 381 and 502 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said section 1 of title XIII of the act of June 15, 1917, are incorporated in sections 1364 and 2275 of this title.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 5 -  United States defined 


This section of the U.S. Code defines what is meant by "United States" in a territorial context, which includes all areas and waters, either continental or insular, that are under U.S. jurisdiction, excluding the Canal Zone. 

The definition was based on various sections of the U.S. Code from 1940 and the act of June 15, 1917. The law underwent minor changes in wording and was consolidated with other sections related to jurisdiction and territorial matters. 

One amendment to this section by the Senate specifically added the exclusion of the Canal Zone, which was a territory once controlled by the U.S., but is now under the jurisdiction of Panama. 

In simpler terms, this section sets the rules for what areas are considered part of the United States when it comes to enforcing U.S. laws.

As used in this title:
The term “department” means one of the executive departments enumerated in section 1 of Title 5, unless the context shows that such term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government.
The term “agency” includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685.)







Historical and Revision Notes
This section defines the terms “department” and “agency” of the United States. The word “department” appears 57 times in title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the word “agency” 14 times. It was considered necessary to define clearly these words in order to avoid possible litigation as to the scope or coverage of a given section containing such words. (See United States v. Germaine, 1878, 99 U.S. 508, 25 L. Ed. 482, for definition of words “department” or “head of department.”)
The phrase “corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest” is intended to include those governmental corporations in which stock is not actually issued, as well as those in which stock is owned by the United States. It excludes those corporations in which the interest of the Government is custodial or incidental.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 6 -  Department and agency defined 


This U.S. Code defines the terms "department" and "agency" as they are used within the context of the law. 

The term "department" is defined as one of the executive departments listed in section 1 of Title 5, unless the context implies that it is referring to the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government. 

The term "agency" is defined to include any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States, or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest. However, this definition can be limited based on the context in which it is used. 

The definition of "agency" specifically includes corporations in which the United States has a financial stake. This could be corporations where stock is not issued, as well as those where stock is owned by the U.S. Corporations where the government's interest is merely custodial or incidental are not included. 

These definitions were established to prevent potential litigation over the scope or coverage of certain sections of the law that use these terms.

Historical and Revision Notes
Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 451 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 272, 35 Stat. 1142; June 11, 1940, ch. 323, 54 Stat. 304).
The words “The term ‘special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States’ as used in this title includes:” were substituted for the words “The crimes and offenses defined in sections 451–468 of this title shall be punished as herein prescribed.”
This section first appeared in the 1909 Criminal Code. It made it possible to combine in one chapter all the penal provisions covering acts within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction without the necessity of repeating in each section the places covered.
The present section has made possible the allocation of the diverse provisions of chapter 11 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to particular chapters restricted to particular offenses, as contemplated by the alphabetical chapter arrangement.
In several revised sections of said chapter 11 the words “within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States” have been added. Thus the jurisdictional limitation will be preserved in all sections of said chapter 11 describing an offense.
Enumeration of names of Great Lakes was omitted as unnecessary.
Other minor changes were necessary now that the section defines a term rather than the place of commission of crime or offense; however, the extent of the special jurisdiction as originally enacted has been carefully followed.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 7 -  Special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States defined 


The U.S. Code 18 Section 7 outlines the "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States." Key points of this law include:

1. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any vessel belonging, wholly or partially, to the U.S, its citizens, or any corporation created under U.S laws when the vessel is within U.S maritime jurisdiction and outside any particular state's jurisdiction.

2. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any vessel registered under U.S. laws and voyaging on the Great Lakes, connecting waters, or the Saint Lawrence River.

3. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any lands reserved or acquired for U.S. use, under exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction.

4. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any island, rock, or key containing guano deposits, at the President's discretion.

5. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any aircraft belonging, wholly or partially, to the U.S, its citizens, or any corporation created under U.S laws when the aircraft is in flight over the high seas or within U.S maritime jurisdiction.

6. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any space vehicle registered under the U.S., from the moment all external doors are closed on Earth following embarkation until one door is opened on Earth for disembarkation.

7. The U.S. has jurisdiction over any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation concerning an offense by or against a U.S. national.

8. The U.S. has jurisdiction, within international law limits, over any foreign vessel voyaging from or to the U.S concerning an offense committed by or against a U.S. national.

9. The U.S. has jurisdiction over the premises of U.S. diplomatic, military, or other government missions in foreign states and residences used by U.S. personnel.

This law has been amended several times since its introduction in 1948, with additions including aircraft and space vehicles, and premises of U.S. missions abroad. The law also states that it does not supersede any conflicting treaties or international agreements.

The term “obligation or other security of the United States” includes all bonds, certificates of indebtedness, national bank currency, Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes, coupons, United States notes, Treasury notes, gold certificates, silver certificates, fractional notes, certificates of deposit, bills, checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the United States, stamps and other representatives of value, of whatever denomination, issued under any Act of Congress, and canceled United States stamps.

Historical and Revision Notes
Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 261 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 147, 35 Stat. 1115; Jan. 27, 1938, ch. 10, § 3, 52 Stat. 7).
The terms of this section were general enough to justify its inclusion in this chapter rather than retaining it in the chapter on “Counterfeiting” where the terms which it specifically defines are set out in sections 471–476, 478, 481, 483, 492, and 504 of this title.
Words “Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes” were inserted before “coupons” because such notes have almost supplanted national bank currency.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 8 -  Obligation or other security of the United States defined 


This section of the U.S. Code broadly defines the term "obligation or other security of the United States" to include virtually all forms of national currency, checks, drafts, and other financial instruments issued by the U.S. government. The goal of this legislation is to cover all possible forms of U.S. issued financial securities to ensure that they are all protected under legal regulations. 

Notably, the code includes not only traditional forms of currency such as bonds and national bank currency but also Federal Reserve notes and Federal Reserve bank notes, which have largely replaced national bank currency. The inclusion of these items underscores the comprehensive nature of the code.

In addition, the term also includes stamps, which are also considered a form of legal tender or representative of value. The inclusion of cancelled U.S. stamps is particularly significant as it extends the definition to include items that have been used and hence no longer have their original face value.

This code was based on earlier laws dating back to 1909 and had been revised over the years, with the most recent revision occurring in 1948. The breadth and inclusivity of the code highlight the government's intention to provide a robust legal framework for protecting U.S. financial securities.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 9 -  Vessel of the United States defined 


This law defines what is considered a "vessel of the United States" within the legal context of the U.S. code. According to this law, a vessel of the United States is any vessel that belongs in part or in whole to the United States, a U.S. citizen, or any corporation created by U.S. laws. This includes corporations from any state, territory, district, or possession of the United States.

Translated into less formal language, this basically means if you're a U.S. citizen, the U.S. government, or a company registered in the U.S. and you own a boat, that boat is considered a "vessel of the United States".

This legal definition was established in June 1948 and is based on a previous version of the law from 1909. It was revised to apply to the entire U.S. code rather than just specific sections. The changes made were mostly small tweaks to the wording of the law.

Historical and Revision Notes
Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) (Oct. 29, 1919, ch. 89, § 2(b), 41 Stat. 325; June 22, 1932, ch. 271, § 2, 47 Stat. 326; May 18, 1934, ch. 301, 48 Stat. 782; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, § 2(a), 48 Stat. 794; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 366, § 2(b), 55 Stat. 631).
This section consolidates into one section identical definitions contained in sections 408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
In addition to slight improvements in style, the word “commerce” was substituted for “transportation” in order to avoid the narrower connotation of the word “transportation” since “commerce” obviously includes more than “transportation.” The word “Possession” was inserted in two places to make the definition more accurate and comprehensive since the places included in the word “Possession” would normally be within the term defined and a narrower construction should be handled by express statutory exclusion in those crimes which Congress intends to restrict to commerce within the continental United States.









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 10 -  Interstate commerce and foreign commerce defined 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the legal definitions of "interstate commerce" and "foreign commerce." According to the code, "interstate commerce" includes any commerce that occurs between different states, territories, possessions, or the District of Columbia. "Foreign commerce," on the other hand, refers to any commerce that takes place with a foreign country.

The definitions were established on June 25, 1948 and are based on previous sections of the U.S. Code. The section was designed to consolidate identical definitions found in multiple sections of the code, and was also slightly reworded for style and accuracy. For example, the word "commerce" was used instead of "transportation" to encompass more than just the movement of goods, and the word "possession" was added to include territories under U.S. control.

In essence, these definitions are fundamental in interpreting and applying numerous federal laws and regulations, particularly those related to business and trade. They underline the fact that when trade or business activities cross state lines or national borders, they fall under the jurisdiction of federal law.

The definition of “foreign government” contained in this section, with minor changes in phraseology, is from section 4 of title VIII of act June 15, 1917 (Ch. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 226), known as the Espionage Act of 1917. This definition was incorporated in sections 98, 288, and 349 of title 18 and in section 235 of title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse, and in section 41 of Title 50, War and National Defense, U.S.C., all in 1940 ed., since the definition was specifically enacted with reference to said sections and others not material here.
The remaining provisions of said sections 98 and 349 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said section 4 of title VIII of the act of June 15, 1917, are incorporated in sections 502 and 957 of this title.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 11 -  Foreign government defined 


This section of the U.S. Code provides the definition of a "foreign government" as used in most parts of the title. It includes any government, faction, or group of insurgents within a country that is at peace with the United States, regardless of whether the U.S. officially recognizes it as a government. The law was primarily based on the Espionage Act of 1917 and has been amended once in 1976 to exclude its application in certain sections of the U.S. Code.

In simpler terms, this law defines what the U.S. considers to be a "foreign government" for the purposes of most of its laws. This doesn't just mean officially recognized governments, but also any groups trying to gain power within a peaceful country. The laws this applies to mostly relate to national security, espionage, and foreign relations.

The only significant amendment to this section happened in 1976, where certain sections were exempted from this definition. This means that for those specific sections, a different definition of "foreign government" might apply. The reasons for this amendment might be due to changes in international relations and politics at the time.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 12 -  United States Postal Service defined 


This section of the U.S. Code defines the term "Postal Service" as the United States Postal Service established under title 39, and includes every officer and employee of that Service, regardless of whether they have taken an oath of office. The definition was amended in 1970 to specifically include the United States Postal Service, replacing the previous definition that referred to the Post Office Department. It was further amended in 1990 to make the language inclusive rather than gender specific. The amendment of 1970 took effect within a year of its enactment, as determined by the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.

Historical and Revision Notes
Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., § 468 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, § 289, 35 Stat. 1145; June 15, 1933, ch. 85, 48 Stat. 152; June 20, 1935, ch. 284, 49 Stat. 394; June 6, 1940, ch. 241, 54 Stat. 234).
Act March 4, 1909, § 289 used the words “now in force” when referring to the laws of any State, organized Territory or district, to be considered in force.
As amended on June 15, 1933, the words “by the laws thereof in force on June 1, 1933, and remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting the doing of such act or thing, would be penal,” were used.
The amendment of June 20, 1935, extended the date to “April 1, 1935,” and the amendment of June 6, 1940, extended the date to “February 1, 1940”.
The revised section omits the specification of any date as unnecessary in a revision, which speaks from the date of its enactment. Such omission will not only make effective within Federal reservations, the local State laws in force on the date of the enactment of the revision, but will authorize the Federal courts to apply the same measuring stick to such offenses as is applied in the adjoining State under future changes of the State law and will make unnecessary periodic pro forma amendments of this section to keep abreast of changes of local laws. In other words, the revised section makes applicable to offenses committed on such reservations, the law of the place that would govern if the reservation had not been ceded to the United States.
The word “Possession” was inserted to clarify scope of section.
Minor changes were made in phraseology.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 13 -  Laws of States adopted for areas within Federal jurisdiction 


This U.S. Code, otherwise known as "Assimilative Crimes Act," extends the criminal laws of a state to areas within federal jurisdiction. 

In essence, if an act or omission is made within any place under federal jurisdiction that is not punishable under federal law, but is punishable under state law, the act or omission will be treated as if it was made within state jurisdiction and the same punishment will be applied.

This also includes areas such as territorial sea of the United States that do not fall within the jurisdiction of any State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district. 

The law was expanded in 1988 to include punishments related to operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol. It set out specific additional penalties if a minor was present in the vehicle at the time of the offense and if the state law does not provide for additional penalties in such circumstances.

In 1996, the law was further expanded to include any portion of the territorial sea of the United States and to increase the range of fines that can be imposed.

Overall, this law is important in maintaining law and order in areas within federal jurisdiction by borrowing from state criminal laws when necessary.

This section of the U.S. Code, specifically 18 U.S. Code § 14, was repealed on November 2, 2002, under Public Law 107-273, division B, title IV, § 4004(a), with its details recorded in the 116 Stat. 1812.

Prior to its repeal, it had been amended several times. First established on June 25, 1948, under Chapter 645, 62 Stat. 686, it was amended on August 5, 1953 (Chapter 325, 67 Stat. 366), October 18, 1962 (Public Law 87-845, § 3(a), 76A Stat. 698), June 22, 1968 (Public Law 90-357, § 59, 82 Stat. 248), November 29, 1990 (Public Law 101-647, Title XXXV, § 3519(c), 104 Stat. 4923), and September 13, 1994 (Public Law 103-322, Title XXXIII, § 330010(9), 108 Stat. 2143). 

Unfortunately, the specific content of 18 U.S. Code § 14 is not mentioned in this passage. However, it does note that this part of the Code was applicable to and within the Canal, possibly referring to the Panama Canal Zone which was under U.S. jurisdiction until 1999. As such, this code could have had implications for activities, regulations, or jurisdiction within this area. Nevertheless, its repeal in 2002 means it is no longer in effect.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 15 -  Obligation or other security of foreign government defined 


This U.S. federal law defines what is meant by an "obligation or other security of any foreign government". According to the law, this term is not limited to, but includes, uncanceled stamps, even if they have been demonetized. This law was introduced in 1958.

In simpler terms, if you have a piece of paper or other item that a foreign government owes something on (like a bond or note), or that represents an investment in a foreign government (like a stock or bond), it's considered an "obligation or other security of any foreign government". Even foreign stamps that haven't been used (uncanceled) count as such, regardless of whether they're still valid for postage (not demonetized).

This might seem strange, but stamps, like other types of securities, represent a promise by the government. In this case, the promise is to deliver a letter or package. So, just like a bond or note, they're considered a type of "obligation".

The term “crime of violence” means—
(a)
 an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or prop­erty of another, or

(b)
 any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.

Constitutionality
For information regarding the constitutionality of this section, as added by section 1001(a) of Pub. L. 98–473, see the Table of Laws Held Unconstitutional in Whole or in Part by the Supreme Court on the Constitution Annotated website, constitution.congress.gov.









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 16 -  Crime of violence defined 


This U.S. Code defines what constitutes a "crime of violence." This includes offenses that involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person or their property. It also includes any felony that inherently involves a substantial risk of physical force being used against another person or their property in the course of the felony.

The code was added in 1984 by the Public Law 98-473, in its title II, section 1001(a). 

In terms of constitutionality, any disputes or controversies regarding this section are referred to the Table of Laws Held Unconstitutional in Whole or in Part by the Supreme Court. This implies that there may have been challenges or debates about whether this section is constitutional or not, although no specific instances are mentioned in this summary.

In a more broad perspective, this law is designed to clearly define what type of actions could be classified as a 'crime of violence' in legal terms. This provides a framework for court cases and legal proceedings, helping to ensure that actions are appropriately classified and that justice is properly served. However, the interpretation of what constitutes a 'substantial risk' of physical force could potentially be subjective and may lead to debates in court.

(a) Affirmative Defense.—
It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

(b) Burden of Proof.—
The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and convincing evidence.

(Added Pub. L. 98–473, title II, § 402(a), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, § 20; renumbered § 17, Pub. L. 99–646, § 34(a), Nov. 10, 1986, 100 Stat. 3599.)












### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 17 -  Insanity defense 


This U.S. federal law outlines the conditions under which a defendant can use an insanity defense, stating that a defendant must have been suffering from a severe mental disease or defect at the time of the crime and was thus unable to understand the nature or wrongfulness of their actions. The law also specifies that the burden of proof for this defense rests on the defendant, who must provide clear and convincing evidence of their insanity. This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1984 and renumbered in 1986. Notably, mental disease or defect, in and of itself, does not qualify as a defense; it must have significantly impacted the defendant's understanding of their actions at the time of the crime.

Amendments
1988—Pub. L. 100–690 made technical correction of directory language of Pub. L. 99–646, § 38(a), similar to that made by Pub. L. 100–185.
1987—Pub. L. 100–185 made technical correction in directory language of Pub. L. 99–646, § 38(a).









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 18 -  Organization defined 


This section of the U.S. Code simply defines the term "organization" as it is used within this specific title. According to this definition, an "organization" is any person other than an individual. This suggests that groups of individuals working together, corporations, or other entities that are legally recognized as "persons" could be considered "organizations."

The law that added this definition to the U.S. Code was passed in 1986, and there have been two amendments to the language of the law since then, both of which were considered "technical corrections". This means that the changes likely did not significantly alter the substance or application of the law, but rather clarified the language or corrected errors.

In layman's terms, this law differentiates between a single individual and any other type of entity, like a business or a nonprofit group, and refers to the latter as "organizations". This definition is likely used throughout the title to make regulations and requirements clear when they apply to "organizations" rather than individuals.

As used in this title, the term “petty offense” means a Class B misdemeanor, a Class C misdemeanor, or an infraction, for which the maximum fine is no greater than the amount set forth for such an offense in section 3571(b)(6) or (7) in the case of an individual or section 3571(c)(6) or (7) in the case of an organization.

Amendments
1988—Pub. L. 100–690 inserted “, for which the maximum fine is no greater than the amount set forth for such an offense in section 3571(b)(6) or (7) in the case of an individual or section 3571(c)(6) or (7) in the case of an organization” after “infraction”.









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 19 -  Petty offense defined 


The term "petty offense" is used in this U.S. code to refer to minor violations that fall under Class B or Class C misdemeanors, or infractions. Such offenses are characterized by a maximum fine that does not exceed the amount stipulated in sections 3571(b)(6) or (7) for individuals, or 3571(c)(6) or (7) for organizations. This definition was introduced in 1987 and later amended in 1988 to further clarify the maximum fine for such offenses. The implication is that these are not serious crimes, perhaps analogous to a traffic ticket or a minor shoplifting incident, rather than a felony like robbery or assault.

(a) Wherever in this title it is an element of an offense that—
(1)
 any property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and

(2)
 the defendant knew that the property was of such character;

such element may be established by proof that the defendant, after or as a result of an official representation as to the nature of the property, believed the property to be embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated.

(b)
 For purposes of this section, the term “official representation” means any representation made by a Federal law enforcement officer (as defined in section 115) or by another person at the direction or with the approval of such an officer.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 21 -  Stolen or counterfeit nature of property for certain crimes defined 


This section of the U.S. Code explains the legal definitions and requirements for crimes involving stolen or counterfeit property. It sets out the conditions for an offense, which are that the property in question was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged or obliterated, and that the defendant knew about the dubious nature of the property.

For the requirements of this law to be met, there needs to be proof that, after or as a result of an 'official representation' (as defined by a Federal law enforcement officer or someone acting on their behalf), the defendant believed the property to be of such dubious nature.

This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1994 as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

As used in this title, except where otherwise expressly provided [2] the term “court of the United States” includes the District Court of Guam, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 23 -  Court of the United States defined 


This section of the U.S. Code essentially defines what is considered a "court of the United States" in the context of the title. Here, it specifies that the term includes the District Court of Guam, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands, unless stated otherwise. This provision was added as part of the Public Law 103-322, title XXXII on September 13, 1994. 

In simpler terms, when laws refer to a "U.S. court", they also mean these district courts in U.S. territories like Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands, unless the law explicitly says they don't. It's like saying, "when I talk about my family, I'm also including my cousins, unless I specifically say I'm not." The change was made in 1994.

(a) As used in this title, the term “Federal health care offense” means a violation of, or a criminal conspiracy to violate—
(1)
 section 669, 1035, 1347, or 1518 of this title or section 1128B of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b); or

(b)
 As used in this title, the term “health care benefit program” means any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.

(Added Pub. L. 104–191, title II, § 241(a), Aug. 21, 1996, 110 Stat. 2016; amended Pub. L. 111–148, title VI, § 6602, title X, § 10606(c), Mar. 23, 2010, 124 Stat. 780, 1008.)

Sections 411, 518, and 511 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), are classified to sections 1111, 1148, and 1141, respectively, of Title 29, Labor.

Amendments
2010—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 111–148, § 10606(c)(1), substituted “or section 1128B of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b); or” for semicolon.
Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 111–148, § 10606(c)(2)(B), which directed insertion of “section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331), or section 501 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1131),” after “title,” was executed by making the insertion after “title” to reflect the probable intent of Congress because “title,” did not appear subsequent to amendment by Pub. L. 111–148, § 6602. See below.
Pub. L. 111–148, § 10606(c)(2)(A), inserted “1349,” after “1343,”.
Pub. L. 111–148, § 6602, inserted “or section 411, 518, or 511 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,” after “1954 of this title”.









### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 24 -  Definitions relating to Federal health care offense 


This section of the U.S. Code defines what constitutes a "Federal health care offense" and "health care benefit program." A "Federal health care offense" refers to a violation of certain sections of this title or a criminal conspiracy to violate these sections, particularly if the violation or conspiracy is related to a health care benefit program. 

The term "health care benefit program" refers to any public or private plan or contract that provides any medical benefit, item, or service to an individual. This includes any individual or entity that provides a medical benefit, item, or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.

Several amendments were added in 2010, which expanded the definition of a violation to include additional sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Social Security Act. These amendments were likely made to ensure broader coverage and stricter enforcement of health care-related offenses.

In essence, this section of the U.S. Code is designed to help regulate and enforce laws around health care, helping to ensure that individuals and entities are held responsible for any potential misuse or misconduct in the health care system.

##  18 U.S. Code § 25 -  Use of minors in crimes of violence 







                        U.S. Code

(a) Definitions.—In this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) Crime of violence.—
The term “crime of violence” has the meaning set forth in section 16.

(2) Minor.—
The term “minor” means a person who has not reached 18 years of age.

(3) Uses.—
The term “uses” means employs, hires, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces.


(b) Penalties.—Any person who is 18 years of age or older, who intentionally uses a minor to commit a crime of violence for which such person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or to assist in avoiding detection or apprehension for such an offense, shall—
(1)
 for the first conviction, be subject to twice the maximum term of imprisonment and twice the maximum fine that would otherwise be authorized for the offense; and

(2)
 for each subsequent conviction, be subject to 3 times the maximum term of imprisonment and 3 times the maximum fine that would otherwise be authorized for the offense.


(Added Pub. L. 108–21, title VI, § 601[(a)], Apr. 30, 2003, 117 Stat. 686.)












### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 25 -  Use of minors in crimes of violence 


This U.S. Code, section 25, is focused on the use of minors in crimes of violence. In this context, 'minor' refers to a person under the age of 18, while 'uses' refers to actions such as employing, hiring, persuading, or coercing a minor. The term 'crime of violence' is defined as per section 16. 

The penalties for violations are severe. If an adult (18 years or older) intentionally uses a minor to commit a violent crime, or to assist in avoiding detection or arrest for such a crime, they can be heavily penalized. For the first conviction, the maximum prison term and fines can be doubled. For any subsequent conviction, these can be tripled. 

This law was added on April 30, 2003, under Pub. L. 108–21, title VI, § 601[(a)]. This law highlights the seriousness with which the U.S. justice system treats crimes involving minors, particularly those of a violent nature. It also indicates the government's intent to reduce the exploitation of minors in criminal activities.

The law can be seen as a counterpart to child protection and juvenile justice laws, focusing on the individuals who exploit minors rather than the minors themselves. It underscores the responsibility adults hold in their interactions with individuals under the age of 18.

As used in this title, the term “seaport” means all piers, wharves, docks, and similar structures, adjacent to any waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to which a vessel may be secured, including areas of land, water, or land and water under and in immediate proximity to such structures, buildings on or contiguous to such structures, and the equipment and materials on such structures or in such buildings.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 26 -  Definition of seaport 


This section of the U.S. Code, added in 2006, provides a clear definition of what constitutes a "seaport" under U.S. jurisdiction. According to the code, a seaport includes not only the physical structures like piers, wharves, and docks where vessels can be moored, but also the nearby land and water areas, any buildings located on or adjacent to these structures, and the equipment and materials found on these structures or within these buildings. This comprehensive definition ensures that all related structures and areas are included in the legal understanding and protection afforded to seaports.

### commentary on ##  18 U.S. Code § 27 -  Mortgage lending business defined 


This section of the U.S. Code defines what constitutes a "mortgage lending business." According to this definition, any organization that finances or refinances any debt that's secured by an interest in real estate, such as private mortgage companies and their subsidiaries, can be considered a mortgage lending business. This especially applies if their activities have an effect on interstate or foreign commerce. This provision was added to the U.S. Code in 2009. 

In simpler terms, if you're an organization and you're in the business of providing money for mortgages, you're considered a mortgage lending business under U.S. federal law. This law is essential as it sets the stage for the regulation of these businesses, particularly those operating across state lines or internationally.
