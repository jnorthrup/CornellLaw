Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
Short Title of 1990 Amendment
Pub. L. 101–550, title IV, § 401, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2721, provided that: “This title [amending sections 77ccc to 77eee, 77iii to 77rrr, and 77vvv of this title] may be cited as the ‘Trust Indenture Reform Act of 1990’.”







The "Trust Indenture Act of 1939" is a subchapter of the U.S. Code that was added on August 3, 1939. It is also referred to as 15 U.S. Code § 77aaa. The act is commonly known by its short title and aims to regulate trust indentures.

In 1990, the act was amended by the Trust Indenture Reform Act, which made changes to various sections of the act. This amendment is sometimes referred to as the "Trust Indenture Reform Act of 1990."

The act itself contains provisions and regulations regarding trust indentures, which are legal agreements that govern the relationship between a borrower and a lender, particularly in bond issuances. These indentures provide a framework for the rights and obligations of both parties.

The act provides safeguards for bondholders and requires certain disclosures and reporting requirements to ensure transparency in the bond market. It sets standards for the content of trust indentures and establishes rules for the appointment of trustees.

This legislation is important in protecting investors and maintaining the integrity of the bond market. It ensures that bond issuers fulfill their obligations to bondholders and provides a legal framework for resolving disputes.

Overall, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, along with its subsequent amendments, plays a crucial role in regulating trust indentures and promoting investor confidence in the bond market.

(a) Practices adversely affecting publicUpon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the Securities and Exchange Commission made to the Congress pursuant to section 78jj of this title and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is hereby declared that the national public interest and the interest of investors in notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certificates of interest or participation therein, which are offered to the public, are adversely affected—
(1)
 when the obligor fails to provide a trustee to protect and enforce the rights and to represent the interests of such investors, notwithstanding the fact that (A) individual action by such investors for the purpose of protecting and enforcing their rights is rendered impracticable by reason of the disproportionate expense of taking such action, and (B) concerted action by such investors in their common interest through representatives of their own selection is impeded by reason of the wide dispersion of such investors through many States, and by reason of the fact that information as to the names and addresses of such investors generally is not available to such investors;

(2)
 when the trustee does not have adequate rights and powers, or adequate duties and responsibilities, in connection with matters relating to the protection and enforcement of the rights of such investors; when, notwithstanding the obstacles to concerted action by such investors, and the general and reasonable assumption by such investors that the trustee is under an affirmative duty to take action for the protection and enforcement of their rights, trust indentures (A) generally provide that the trustee shall be under no duty to take any such action, even in the event of default, unless it receives notice of default, demand for action, and indemnity, from the holders of substantial percentages of the securities outstanding thereunder, and (B) generally relieve the trustee from liability even for its own negligent action or failure to act;

(3)
 when the trustee does not have resources commensurate with its responsibilities, or has any relationship to or connection with the obligor or any underwriter of any securities of the obligor, or holds, beneficially or otherwise, any interest in the obligor or any such underwriter, which relationship, connection, or interest involves a material conflict with the interests of such investors;

(4)
 when the obligor is not obligated to furnish to the trustee under the indenture and to such investors adequate current information as to its financial condition, and as to the performance of its obligations with respect to the securities outstanding under such indenture; or when the communication of such information to such investors is impeded by the fact that information as to the names and addresses of such investors generally is not available to the trustee and to such investors;

(5)
 when the indenture contains provisions which are misleading or deceptive, or when full and fair disclosure is not made to prospective investors of the effect of important indenture provisions; or

(6)
 when, by reason of the fact that trust indentures are commonly prepared by the obligor or underwriter in advance of the public offering of the securities to be issued thereunder, such investors are unable to participate in the preparation thereof, and, by reason of their lack of understanding of the situation, such investors would in any event be unable to procure the correction of the defects enumerated in this subsection.


(b) Declaration of policy

Practices of the character above enumerated have existed to such an extent that, unless regulated, the public offering of notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certificates of interest or participation therein, by the use of means and instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce and of the mails, is injurious to the capital markets, to investors, and to the general public; and it is hereby declared to be the policy of this subchapter, in accordance with which policy all the provisions of this subchapter shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and eliminate the practices, enumerated in this section, connected with such public offerings.


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 302, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1150.)

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77bbb states the necessity for regulation in the securities industry in the United States. It declares that the national public interest and the interest of investors in certain financial instruments offered to the public are adversely affected by various practices.

These practices include situations where the obligor (the entity responsible for repayment) fails to provide a trustee to protect and enforce the rights of investors. This is particularly problematic when individual or concerted action by investors is impracticable due to high costs or the wide dispersion of investors.

Furthermore, the code highlights issues with trustees who lack adequate powers and responsibilities, as well as resources commensurate with their responsibilities. It also raises concerns about trustees having conflicts of interest or connections with the obligor or underwriters of the securities, which may compromise the interests of investors.

The code also identifies situations where obligors are not obligated to provide adequate current information about their financial condition and the performance of their obligations to investors. This lack of transparency is exacerbated by the fact that information about investors is often not available to the trustee and vice versa.

Additionally, the code points out misleading or deceptive provisions in trust indentures, as well as a lack of full and fair disclosure to prospective investors about important provisions.

Finally, the code acknowledges that trust indentures are typically prepared by the obligor or underwriter before the public offering of the securities. This prevents investors from participating in their preparation and potentially correcting any defects.

The code states that these practices have been prevalent and that unless regulated, the public offering of certain financial instruments through interstate commerce and the mail is harmful to the capital markets, investors, and the general public. Therefore, the policy of this subchapter is to address these problems and eliminate the identified practices associated with public offerings of securities.

This code was added in 1939 to the Securities Act of 1933, which was enacted in response to the stock market crash of 1929 and aimed to restore investor confidence in the securities market.

The 15 U.S. Code § 77ddd is a section of the United States Code that outlines the exemptions for certain securities and transactions from the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.

The section provides a list of specific securities that are exempt from the provisions of the Securities Act. These include securities such as notes, bonds, debentures, or evidence of indebtedness, as well as certificates of interest or participation in such securities. It also includes securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign government or its subdivisions, as well as securities issued under mortgage indentures with insurance under the National Housing Act.

The section also states that the exemptions provided in this subsection may be applied within certain limits, such as an aggregate principal amount of securities issued by the same issuer.

The section further states that certain provisions of the Securities Act, such as sections 77eee and 77fff, do not apply to transactions exempted by section 5 of the Securities Act or transactions that would be exempted but for certain conditions.

The section also allows the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exempt securities or transactions from the provisions of this subchapter if it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.

Lastly, the section allows the SEC to add to the list of exempted securities any class of securities issued by a small business investment company if it finds that enforcement of the securities laws is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors.

Overall, this section provides exemptions for certain securities and transactions from the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, allowing for more flexibility in the securities market.

(a) Information requiredSubject to the provisions of section 77ddd of this title, a registration statement relating to a security shall include the following information and documents, as though such inclusion were required by the provisions of section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77g]—
(1)
 such information and documents as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe in order to enable the Commission to determine whether any person designated to act as trustee under the indenture under which such security has been or is to be issued is eligible to act as such under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title; and

(2)
 an analysis of any provisions of such indenture with respect to (A) the definition of what shall constitute a default under such indenture, and the withholding of notice to the indenture security holders of any such default, (B) the authentication and delivery of the indenture securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, (C) the release or the release and substitution of any property subject to the lien of the indenture, (D) the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, and (E) the evidence required to be furnished by the obligor upon the indenture securities to the trustee as to compliance with the conditions and covenants provided for in such indenture.

The information and documents required by paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to the person designated to act as indenture trustee shall be contained in a separate part of such registration statement, which part shall be signed by such person. Such part of the registration statement shall be deemed to be a document filed pursuant to this subchapter, and the provisions of sections 11, 12, 17, and 24 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77k, 77l, 77q, 77x] shall not apply to statements therein or omissions therefrom.

(b) Refusal of registration statement
(1) Except as may be permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission shall issue an order prior to the effective date of registration refusing to permit such a registration statement to become effective, if it finds that—
(A)
 the security to which such registration statement relates has not been or is not to be issued under an indenture; or

(B)
 any person designated as trustee under such indenture is not eligible to act as such under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title;

but no such order shall be issued except after notice and opportunity for hearing within the periods and in the manner required with respect to refusal orders pursuant to section 8(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h(b)]. If and when the Commission deems that the objections on which such order was based have been met, the Commission shall enter an order rescinding such refusal order, and the registration shall become effective at the time provided in section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h(a)], or upon the date of such rescission, whichever shall be the later.

(2)
 In the case of securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], which securities are eligible to be issued, offered, or sold on a delayed basis by or on behalf of the registrant, the Commission shall not be required to issue an order pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section for failure to designate a trustee eligible to act under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title if, in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Commission, the issuer of such securities files an application for the purpose of determining such trustee’s eligibility under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title. The Commission shall issue an order prior to the effective date of such application refusing to permit the application to become effective, if it finds that any person designated as trustee under such indenture is not eligible to act as such under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title, but no order shall be issued except after notice and opportunity for hearing within the periods and in the manner required with respect to refusal orders pursuant to section 8(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h(b)]. If after notice and opportunity for hearing the Commission issues an order under this provision, the obligor shall within 5 calendar days appoint a trustee meeting the requirements of subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title. No such appointment shall be effective and such refusal order shall not be rescinded by the Commission until a person eligible to act as trustee under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title has been appointed. If no order is issued, an application filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective the tenth day after filing thereof or such earlier date as the Commission may determine, having due regard to the adequacy of information provided therein, the public interest, and the protection of investors.


(c) Information required in prospectus

A prospectus relating to any such security shall include to the extent the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations as necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, as though such inclusion were required by section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77j], a written statement containing the analysis set forth in the registration statement, of any indenture provisions with respect to the matters specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, together with a supplementary analysis, prepared by the Commission, of such provisions and of the effect thereof, if, in the opinion of the Commission, the inclusion of such supplementary analysis is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and the Commission so declares by order after notice and, if demanded by the issuer, opportunity for hearing thereon. Such order shall be entered prior to the effective date of registration, except that if opportunity for hearing thereon is demanded by the issuer such order shall be entered within a reasonable time after such opportunity for hearing.


(d) Applicability of other statutory provisions

The provisions of sections 11, 12, 17, and 24 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77k, 77l, 77q, 77x], and the provisions of sections 77www and 77yyy of this title, shall not apply to statements in or omissions from any analysis required under the provisions of this section or section 77fff or 77ggg of this title.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







This section of the U.S. Code outlines the requirements for securities that must be registered under the Securities Act. It states that a registration statement for a security must include specific information and documents, including details about the trustee designated under the indenture for the security. The registration statement must also analyze the provisions of the indenture, such as default definitions, release of property, and compliance with conditions and covenants.

The section also specifies that the information and documents regarding the trustee must be contained in a separate part of the registration statement and signed by the trustee. It further states that this part of the registration statement is considered a filed document and is subject to certain provisions of the Securities Act.

If the Commission finds that the security is not issued under an indenture or that the designated trustee is not eligible to act under the law, it may refuse to permit the registration statement to become effective. However, the Commission must provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before issuing such an order. If the objections raised by the Commission are resolved, the Commission will rescind the refusal order and the registration will become effective.

There is an exception for securities registered under the Securities Act that are eligible to be issued on a delayed basis. In this case, the Commission is not required to issue a refusal order for failure to designate an eligible trustee, as long as the issuer files an application to determine the trustee's eligibility. However, if the Commission finds that the designated trustee is not eligible, it may issue a refusal order after notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The obligor must then appoint an eligible trustee within 5 calendar days. The application will be effective unless an order is issued, and the refusal order will only be rescinded once an eligible trustee is appointed.

The section also states that a prospectus for the security must include an analysis of the indenture provisions specified in the registration statement. The Commission may require a supplementary analysis if it deems it necessary for the public interest or the protection of investors.

Lastly, the section specifies that certain provisions of the Securities Act do not apply to the analysis required under this section, as well as other related provisions.

This section was added to the U.S. Code in 1939 and has been amended since, including amendments in 1954 and 1990. The amendments clarified certain provisions and allowed the Commission to prescribe the extent to which summaries of indenture provisions must be included in prospectuses.

Overall, this section outlines the information and requirements for registering securities under the Securities Act and ensures that the trustee designated under the indenture meets the eligibility criteria.

The application must include the necessary information and documents required by SEC regulations. 

The information and documents required include details about the person designated to act as the indenture trustee. The application must also include any other information and documents that would be required for the registration of such indenture securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The applicant can withdraw the application at any time before it becomes effective.

The information and documents contained in the application are made available to the public under SEC regulations. Copies of the application can be obtained by applicants at a reasonable charge determined by the SEC.

The filing of an application or an amendment to an application is considered complete upon receipt by the SEC. The provisions of section 77h of this title and subsection (b) of section 77eee of this title, which relate to registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, apply to these applications.

This section was added to the U.S. Code in 1939 and was later amended in 2002 to specify the filing fee for applications.

Overall, this section ensures that the qualification process for indentures covering securities not required to be registered is in line with the requirements set forth by the SEC and the Securities Act of 1933.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77hhh, titled "Integration of procedure with Securities Act and other Acts," discusses the incorporation of information and documents required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The SEC is authorized to allow the filing of information or documents by incorporating them by reference from existing filings with the SEC under the aforementioned Acts. This means that companies can refer to previously filed information or documents instead of filing them again, as long as they are already on file with the SEC.

The SEC is also required to provide rules and regulations for consolidating applications, reports, and proceedings under this subchapter with registration statements, applications, reports, and proceedings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This allows for streamlined and consolidated processes when dealing with filings and proceedings related to securities.

This provision was added to the Code in 1939 and was later amended in 2010 to remove reference to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The amendment clarified that the integration of procedures applies to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Overall, this provision aims to simplify and streamline the filing and regulatory processes for securities offerings and transactions, ensuring efficient compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.

(a) Effective time of registration or application for qualification of indentureThe indenture under which a security has been or is to be issued shall be deemed to have been qualified under this subchapter—
(1)
 when registration becomes effective as to such security; or

(2)
 when an application for the qualification of such indenture becomes effective, pursuant to section 77ggg of this title.


(b) Stop orders after effective time of qualification

After qualification has become effective as to the indenture under which a security has been or is to be issued, no stop order shall be issued pursuant to section 77h(d) of this title, suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to such security or of the application for qualification of such indenture, except on one or more of the grounds specified in section 77h of this title, or the failure of the issuer to file an application as provided for by section 77eee(b)(2) of this title.


(c) Effect of subsequent rule or regulation on qualification

The making, amendment, or rescission of a rule, regulation, or order under the provisions of this subchapter (except to the extent authorized by subsection (a) of section 77nnn of this title with respect to rules and regulations prescribed pursuant to such subsection) shall not affect the qualification, form, or interpretation of any indenture as to which qualification became effective prior to the making, amendment, or rescission of such rule, regulation, or order.


(d) Liability of trustee under qualified indenture

No trustee under an indenture which has been qualified under this subchapter shall be subject to any liability because of any failure of such indenture to comply with any of the provisions of this subchapter, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77iii discusses the effective time of qualification for an indenture, which is a legal agreement between an issuer and a trustee for a security that is being issued. The code states that an indenture shall be deemed to have been qualified under this subchapter when the registration becomes effective for the security or when an application for the qualification of the indenture becomes effective. 

Once the qualification of the indenture becomes effective, no stop order can be issued to suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement or the application for qualification, unless it is based on specific grounds specified in section 77h or if the issuer fails to file an application as required by section 77eee(b)(2).

The code also states that any subsequent rule, regulation, or order made, amended, or rescinded under this subchapter shall not affect the qualification, form, or interpretation of any indenture that became effective prior to the making, amendment, or rescission of such rule, regulation, or order.

Furthermore, the code states that a trustee under a qualified indenture shall not be held liable for any failure of the indenture to comply with the provisions of this subchapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

Lastly, the code clarifies that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not have the authority to conduct investigations or proceedings to enforce compliance with the provisions of a qualified indenture.

(a) Persons eligible for appointment as trustee
(1)
 There shall at all times be one or more trustees under every indenture qualified or to be qualified pursuant to this subchapter, at least one of whom shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State or Territory or of the District of Columbia or a corporation or other person permitted to act as trustee by the Commission (referred to in this subchapter as the institutional trustee), which (A) is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and (B) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State, Territorial, or District of Columbia authority. The Commission may, pursuant to such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, or by order on application, permit a corporation or other person organized and doing business under the laws of a foreign government to act as sole trustee under an indenture qualified or to be qualified pursuant to this subchapter, if such corporation or other person (i) is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and (ii) is subject to supervision or examination by authority of such foreign government or a political subdivision thereof substantially equivalent to supervision or examination applicable to United States institutional trustees. In prescribing such rules and regulations or making such order, the Commission shall consider whether under such laws, a United States institutional trustee is eligible to act as sole trustee under an indenture relating to securities sold within the jurisdiction of such foreign government.

(2)
 Such institution [1] trustee shall have at all times a combined capital and surplus of a specified minimum amount, which shall not be less than $150,000. If such institutional trustee publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, the indenture may provide that, for the purposes of this paragraph, the combined capital and surplus of such trustee shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

(3)
 If the indenture to be qualified requires or permits the appointment of one or more co-trustees in addition to such institutional trustee, the rights, powers, duties, and obligations conferred or imposed upon the trustees or any of them shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by such institutional trustee, or such institutional trustee and such co-trustees jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, such institutional trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties, and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustees.

(4)
 In the case of certificates of interest or participation, the indenture trustee or trustees shall have the legal power to exercise all of the rights, powers, and privileges of a holder of the security or securities in which such certificates evidence an interest or participation.

(5)
 No obligor upon the indenture securities or person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such obligor shall serve as trustee upon such indenture securities.


(b) Disqualification of trusteeIf any indenture trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting interest as hereinafter defined—
(i)
 then, within 90 days after ascertaining that it has such conflicting interest, and if the default (as defined in the next sentence) to which such conflicting interest relates has not been cured or duly waived or otherwise eliminated before the end of such 90-day period, such trustee shall either eliminate such conflicting interest or, except as otherwise provided below in this subsection, resign, and the obligor upon the indenture securities shall take prompt steps to have a successor appointed in the manner provided in the indenture;

(ii)
 in the event that such trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of clause (i) of this subsection, such trustee shall, within 10 days after the expiration of such 90-day period, transmit notice of such failure to the indenture security holders in the manner and to the extent provided in subsection (c) of section 77mmm of this title; and

(iii)
 subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of section 77ooo of this title, unless such trustee’s duty to resign is stayed as provided below in this subsection, any security holder who has been a bona fide holder of indenture securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of such trustee, and the appointment of a successor, if such trustee fails, after written request thereof by such holder to comply with the provisions of clause (i) of this subsection.

For the purposes of this subsection, an indenture trustee shall be deemed to have a conflicting interest if the indenture securities are in default (as such term is defined in such indenture, but exclusive of any period of grace or requirement of notice) and—
(1) such trustee is trustee under another indenture under which any other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in any other securities, of an obligor upon the indenture securities are outstanding or is trustee for more than one outstanding series of securities, as hereafter defined, under a single indenture of an obligor, unless—
(A)
 the indenture securities are collateral trust notes under which the only collateral consists of securities issued under such other indenture,

(B)
 such other indenture is a collateral trust indenture under which the only collateral consists of indenture securities, or

(C)
 such obligor has no substantial unmortgaged assets and is engaged primarily in the business of owning, or of owning and developing and/or operating, real estate, and the indenture to be qualified and such other indenture are secured by wholly separate and distinct parcels of real estate:

Provided, That the indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that such provision is excluded) to contain a provision excluding from the operation of this paragraph other series under such indenture, and any other indenture or indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in other securities, of such an obligor are outstanding, if—
(i)
 the indenture to be qualified and any such other indenture or indentures (and all series of securities issuable thereunder) are wholly unsecured and rank equally, and such other indenture or indentures (and such series) are specifically described in the indenture to be qualified or are thereafter qualified under this subchapter, unless the Commission shall have found and declared by order pursuant to subsection (b) of section 77eee of this title or subsection (c) of section 77ggg of this title that differences exist between the provisions of the indenture (or such series) to be qualified and the provisions of such other indenture or indentures (or such series) which are so likely to involve a material conflict of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors to disqualify such trustee from acting as such under one of such indentures, or

(ii)
 the issuer shall have sustained the burden of proving, on application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that trusteeship under the indenture to be qualified and such other indenture or under more than one outstanding series under a single indenture is not so likely to involve a material conflict of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors to disqualify such trustee from acting as such under one of such indentures or with respect to such series;


(2)
 such trustee or any of its directors or executive officers is an underwriter for an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(3)
 such trustee directly or indirectly controls or is directly or indirectly controlled by or is under direct or indirect common control with an underwriter for an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(4) such trustee or any of its directors or executive officers is a director, officer, partner, employee, appointee, or representative of an obligor upon the indenture securities, or of an underwriter (other than the trustee itself) for such an obligor who is currently engaged in the business of underwriting, except that—
(A)
 one individual may be a director and/or an executive officer of the trustee and a director and/or an executive officer of such obligor, but may not be at the same time an executive officer of both the trustee and of such obligor,

(B)
 if and so long as the number of directors of the trustee in office is more than nine, one additional individual may be a director and/or an executive officer of the trustee and a director of such obligor, and

(C)
 such trustee may be designated by any such obligor or by any underwriter for any such obligor, to act in the capacity of transfer agent, registrar, custodian, paying agent, fiscal agent, escrow agent, or depositary, or in any other similar capacity, or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, to act as trustee, whether under an indenture or otherwise;


(5)
 10 per centum or more of the voting securities of such trustee is beneficially owned either by an obligor upon the indenture securities or by any director, partner or executive officer thereof, or 20 per centum or more of such voting securities is beneficially owned, collectively by any two or more of such persons; or 10 per centum or more of the voting securities of such trustee is beneficially owned either by an underwriter for any such obligor or by any director, partner, or executive officer thereof, or is beneficially owned, collectively, by any two or more such persons;

(6) such trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral security for an obligation which is in default as hereinafter defined—
(A)
 5 per centum or more of the voting securities, or 10 per centum or more of any other class of security, of an obligor upon the indenture securities, not including indentures [2] securities and securities issued under any other indenture under which such trustee is also trustee, or

(B)
 10 per centum or more of any class of security of an underwriter for any such obligor;


(7)
 such trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral security for an obligation which is in default as hereinafter defined, 5 per centum or more of the voting securities of any person who, to the knowledge of the trustee, owns 10 per centum or more of the voting securities of, or controls directly or indirectly or is under direct or indirect common control with, an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(8)
 such trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral security for an obligation which is in default as hereinafter defined, 10 per centum or more of any class of security of any person who, to the knowledge of the trustee, owns 50 per centum or more of the voting securities of an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(9)
 such trustee owns, on the date of default upon the indenture securities (as such term is defined in such indenture but exclusive of any period of grace or requirement of notice) or any anniversary of such default while such default upon the indenture securities remains outstanding, in the capacity of executor, administrator, testamentary or inter vivos trustee, guardian, committee or conservator, or in any other similar capacity, an aggregate of 25 per centum or more of the voting securities, or of any class of security, of any person, the beneficial ownership of a specified percentage of which would have constituted a conflicting interest under paragraph (6), (7), or (8) of this subsection. As to any such securities of which the indenture trustee acquired ownership through becoming executor, administrator or testamentary trustee of an estate which include them, the provisions of the preceding sentence shall not apply for a period of not more than 2 years from the date of such acquisition, to the extent that such securities included in such estate do not exceed 25 per centum of such voting securities or 25 per centum of any such class of security. Promptly after the dates of any such default upon the indenture securities and annually in each succeeding year that the indenture securities remain in default the trustee shall make a check of its holding of such securities in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of such dates. If the obligor upon the indenture securities fails to make payment in full of principal or interest under such indenture when and as the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for 30 days thereafter, the trustee shall make a prompt check of its holdings of such securities in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of the date of the expiration of such 30-day period, and after such date, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, all such securities so held by the trustee, with sole or joint control over such securities vested in it, shall be considered as though beneficially owned by such trustee, for the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) of this subsection; or

(10)
 except under the circumstances described in paragraphs [3] (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of section 77kkk(b) of this title, the trustee shall be or shall become a creditor of the obligor.

For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, and of section 77ppp(a) of this title, the term “series of securities” or “series” means a series, class or group of securities issuable under an indenture pursuant to whose terms holders of one such series may vote to direct the indenture trustee, or otherwise take action pursuant to a vote of such holders, separately from holders of another such series: Provided, That “series of securities” or “series” shall not include any series of securities issuable under an indenture if all such series rank equally and are wholly unsecured.
The specification of percentages in paragraphs (5) to (9), inclusive, of this subsection shall not be construed as indicating that the ownership of such percentages of the securities of a person is or is not necessary or sufficient to constitute direct or indirect control for the purposes of paragraph (3) or (7) of this subsection.
For the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), (8), and (9) of this subsection—
(A)
 the terms “security” and “securities” shall include only such securities as are generally known as corporate securities, but shall not include any note or other evidence of indebtedness issued to evidence an obligation to repay moneys lent to a person by one or more banks, trust companies, or banking firms, or any certificate of interest or participation in any such note or evidence of indebtedness;

(B)
 an obligation shall be deemed to be in default when a default in payment of principal shall have continued for thirty days or more, and shall not have been cured; and

(C)
 the indenture trustee shall not be deemed the owner or holder of (i) any security which it holds as collateral security (as trustee or otherwise) for any obligation which is not in default as above defined, or (ii) any security which it holds as collateral security under the indenture to be qualified, irrespective of any default thereunder, or (iii) any security which it holds as agent for collection, or as custodian, escrow agent or depositary, or in any similar representative capacity.

For the purposes of this subsection, the term “underwriter” when used with reference to an obligor upon the indenture securities means every person who, within one year prior to the time as of which the determination is made, was an underwriter of any security of such obligor outstanding at the time of the determination.
Except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any indenture security, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment, the indenture trustee shall not be required to resign as provided by this subsection if such trustee shall have sustained the burden of proving, on application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that—
(i)
 the default under the indenture may be cured or waived during a reasonable period and under the procedures described in such application, and

(ii)
 a stay of the trustee’s duty to resign will not be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the indenture securities. The filing of such an application shall automatically stay the performance of the duty to resign until the Commission orders otherwise.

Any resignation of an indenture trustee shall become effective only upon the appointment of a successor trustee and such successor’s acceptance of such an appointment.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







Summary: 

The 15 U.S. Code § 77jjj establishes the eligibility and disqualification requirements for trustees under indenture agreements. The code states that there must always be at least one trustee, referred to as the institutional trustee, who is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state, territory, or district. The institutional trustee must have the authority to exercise corporate trust powers and be subject to supervision or examination by a Federal, State, Territorial, or District of Columbia authority.

The code also allows for foreign corporations or persons to act as sole trustees under qualified indenture agreements if they meet certain criteria and are subject to supervision or examination by a foreign government authority equivalent to that of U.S. institutional trustees.

In addition, the institutional trustee must have a minimum combined capital and surplus of $150,000. If the trustee publishes reports of its financial condition annually, the indenture may consider the most recent published report as the trustee's combined capital and surplus.

If the indenture allows for co-trustees in addition to the institutional trustee, the institutional trustee or a combination of the institutional trustee and co-trustees will have the rights, powers, duties, and obligations conferred upon the trustees. However, if the institutional trustee is incompetent or unqualified to perform certain acts under the laws of a jurisdiction, the co-trustees will perform those acts.

The code also prohibits any obligor or person controlling or controlled by the obligor from serving as a trustee for the indenture securities.

If an indenture trustee has a conflicting interest, as defined in the code, they must eliminate the conflicting interest within 90 days or resign. Failure to comply with this provision requires the trustee to notify the indenture security holders and may result in the removal of the trustee upon request by a security holder.

A conflicting interest is deemed to exist if the trustee is also a trustee under another indenture for an obligor with outstanding securities, or if the trustee is an underwriter for an obligor or is controlled by an underwriter. The trustee is also disqualified if any of its directors or executive officers have a conflicting interest or if the trustee has a significant ownership stake from an obligor or its directors, partners, or executive officers.

Overall, the code sets forth strict eligibility and disqualification requirements for trustees under indenture agreements to ensure the protection of investors' interests.

(a) Trustee as creditor of obligorSubject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, if the indenture trustee shall be, or shall become, a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured, of an obligor upon the indenture securities, within three months prior to a default as defined in the last paragraph of this subsection, or subsequent to such a default, then, unless and until such default shall be cured, such trustee shall set apart and hold in a special account for the benefit of the trustee individually and the indenture security holders—
(1)
 an amount equal to any and all reductions in the amount due and owing upon any claim as such creditor in respect of principal or interest, effected after the beginning of such three months’ period and valid as against such obligor and its other creditors, except any such reduction resulting from the receipt or disposition of any property described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, or from the exercise of any right of setoff which the trustee could have exercised if a petition in bankruptcy had been filed by or against such obligor upon the date of such default; and

(2)
 all property received in respect of any claim as such creditor, either as security therefor, or in satisfaction or composition thereof, or otherwise, after the beginning of such three months’ period, or an amount equal to the proceeds of any such property, if disposed of, subject, however, to the rights, if any, of such obligor and its other creditors in such property or such proceeds.

Nothing herein contained shall affect the right of the indenture trustee—
(A)
 to retain for its own account (i) payments made on account of any such claim by any person (other than such obligor) who is liable thereon, and (ii) the proceeds of the bona fide sale of any such claim by the trustee to a third person, and (iii) distributions made in cash, securities, or other property in respect of claims filed against such obligor in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law;

(B)
 to realize, for its own account, upon any property held by it as security for any such claim, if such property was so held prior to the beginning of such three months’ period;

(C)
 to realize, for its own account, but only to the extent of the claim hereinafter mentioned, upon any property held by it as security for any such claim, if such claim was created after the beginning of such three months’ period and such property was received as security therefor simultaneously with the creation thereof, and if the trustee shall sustain the burden of proving that at the time such property was so received the trustee had no reasonable cause to believe that a default as defined in the last paragraph of this subsection would occur within three months; or

(D)
 to receive payment on any claim referred to in paragraph (B) or (C) of this subsection, against the release of any property held as security for such claim as provided in said paragraph (B) or (C), as the case may be, to the extent of the fair value of such property.

For the purposes of paragraphs (B), (C), and (D) of this subsection, property substituted after the beginning of such three months’ period for property held as security at the time of such substitution shall, to the extent of the fair value of the property released, have the same status as the property released, and, to the extent that any claim referred to in any of such paragraphs is created in renewal of or in substitution for or for the purpose of repaying or refunding any preexisting claim of the indenture trustee as such creditor, such claim shall have the same status as such preexisting claim.
If the trustee shall be required to account, the funds and property held in such special account and the proceeds thereof shall be apportioned between the trustee and the indenture security holders in such manner that the trustee and the indenture security holders realize, as a result of payments from such special account and payments of dividends on claims filed against such obligor in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, the same percentage of their respective claims, figured before crediting to the claim of the trustee anything on account of the receipt by it from such obligor of the funds and property in such special account and before crediting to the respective claims of the trustee and the indenture security holders dividends on claims filed against such obligor in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, but after crediting thereon receipts on account of the indebtedness represented by their respective claims from all sources other than from such dividends and from the funds and property so held in such special account. As used in this paragraph, with respect to any claim, the term “dividends” shall include any distribution with respect to such claim, in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, whether such distribution is made in cash, securities, or other property, but shall not include any such distribution with respect to the secured portion, if any, of such claim. The court in which such bankruptcy, receivership, or proceeding for reorganization is pending shall have jurisdiction (i) to apportion between the indenture trustee and the indenture security holders, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the funds and property held in such special account and the proceeds thereof, or (ii) in lieu of such apportionment, in whole or in part, to give to the provisions of this paragraph due consideration in determining the fairness of the distributions to be made to the indenture trustee and the indenture security holders with respect to their respective claims, in which event it shall not be necessary to liquidate or to appraise the value of any securities or other property held in such special account or as security for any such claim, or to make a specific allocation of such distributions as between the secured and unsecured portions of such claims, or otherwise to apply the provisions of this paragraph as a mathematical formula.
Any indenture trustee who has resigned or been removed after the beginning of such three months’ period shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection as though such resignation or removal had not occurred. Any indenture trustee who has resigned or been removed prior to the beginning of such three months’ period shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection if and only if the following conditions exist—
(i)
 the receipt of property or reduction of claim which would have given rise to the obligation to account, if such indenture trustee had continued as trustee, occurred after the beginning of such three months’ period; and

(ii)
 such receipt of property or reduction of claim occurred within three months after such resignation or removal.

As used in this subsection, the term “default” means any failure to make payment in full of principal or interest, when and as the same becomes due and payable, under any indenture which has been qualified under this subchapter, and under which the indenture trustee is trustee and the person of whom the indenture trustee is directly or indirectly a creditor is an obligor; and the term “indenture security holder” means all holders of securities outstanding under any such indenture under which any such default exists. In any case commenced under the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, or any amendment thereto enacted prior to November 6, 1978, all references to periods of three months shall be deemed to be references to periods of four months.

(b) Exclusion of creditor relationship arising from specified classesThe indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions excluding from the operation of subsection (a) of this section a creditor relationship arising from—
(1)
 the ownership or acquisition of securities issued under any indenture, or any security or securities having a maturity of one year or more at the time of acquisition by the indenture trustee;

(2)
 advances authorized by a receivership or bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction, or by the indenture, for the purpose of preserving the property subject to the lien of the indenture or of discharging tax liens or other prior liens or encumbrances on the trust estate, if notice of such advance and of the circumstances surrounding the making thereof is given to the indenture security holders, at the time and in the manner provided in the indenture;

(3)
 disbursements made in the ordinary course of business in the capacity of trustee under an indenture, transfer agent, registrar, custodian, paying agent, fiscal agent or depositary, or other similar capacity;

(4)
 an indebtedness created as a result of services rendered or premises rented; or an indebtedness created as a result of goods or securities sold in a cash transaction as defined in the indenture;

(5)
 the ownership of stock or of other securities of a corporation organized under the provisions of section 25(a) [1] of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended [12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.], which is directly or indirectly a creditor of an obligor upon the indenture securities; or

(6)
 the acquisition, ownership, acceptance, or negotiation of any drafts, bills of exchange, acceptances, or obligations which fall within the classification of self-liquidating paper as defined in the indenture.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77kkk outlines the provisions regarding preferential collection of claims against an obligor. According to this code, if the trustee of an indenture becomes a creditor of the obligor within three months prior to or after a default, they must set apart and hold in a special account any reductions in the amount due on their claim, as well as any property received in respect of their claim. However, the trustee still retains certain rights, such as retaining payments made on the claim by someone other than the obligor, realizing on any property held as security, and receiving payment on the claim against the release of any property held as security.

If the trustee is required to account, the funds and property held in the special account and their proceeds are apportioned between the trustee and the indenture security holders in a manner that allows them to realize the same percentage of their respective claims. The court overseeing the bankruptcy, receivership, or reorganization proceedings has jurisdiction to determine the distribution of funds and property held in the special account, taking into consideration the provisions of this code.

The code also specifies certain creditor relationships that are excluded from the provisions of this section, including ownership or acquisition of securities issued under the indenture, advances authorized by a court or the indenture for preservation of the property, disbursements made in the ordinary course of business, indebtedness resulting from services rendered or goods sold, ownership of securities of a creditor corporation, and acquisition of self-liquidating paper.

Overall, this code provides guidelines for the preferential treatment of claims against an obligor by the trustee of an indenture.

(a) Periodic filing of information by obligor with trustee

Each obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the institutional trustee thereunder at stated intervals of not more than six months, and at such other times as such trustee may request in writing, all information in the possession or control of such obligor, or of any of its paying agents, as to the names and addresses of the indenture security holders, and requiring such trustee to preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all such information so furnished to it or received by it in the capacity of paying agent.


(b) Access of information to security holdersWithin five business days after the receipt by the institutional trustee of a written application by any three or more indenture security holders stating that the applicants desire to communicate with other indenture security holders with respect to their rights under such indenture or under the indenture securities, and accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, and by reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned an indenture security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, such institutional trustee shall, at its election, either—
(1)
 afford to such applicants access to all information so furnished to or received by such trustee; or

(2)
 inform such applicants as to the approximate number of indenture security holders according to the most recent information so furnished to or received by such trustee, and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such indenture security holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.

If such trustee shall elect not to afford to such applicants access to such information, such trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to all such indenture security holders copies of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to such trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of such mailing, unless within five days after such tender, such trustee shall mail to such applicants, and file with the Commission together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of such trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the indenture security holders or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. After opportunity for hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, the Commission may, and if demanded by such trustee or by such applicants shall, enter an order either sustaining one or more of such objections or refusing to sustain any of them. If the Commission shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections, or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring, such trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such indenture security holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender.

(c) Disclosure of information deemed not violative of any law

The disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the indenture security holders in accordance with the provisions of this section, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, shall not be deemed to be a violation of any existing law, or of any law hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to this section, nor shall such trustee be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under subsection (b) of this section.


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 312, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1164; amended Pub. L. 101–550, title IV, § 410, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2728.)

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77lll, also known as the Bondholders’ lists, is a federal law that requires obligors (entities responsible for fulfilling obligations) to provide information to institutional trustees regarding the names and addresses of bondholders. This information must be provided at regular intervals, not exceeding six months, and upon request by the trustee.

Additionally, the law grants security holders the right to access this information. If three or more security holders submit a written application to the trustee, stating their desire to communicate with other bondholders about their rights and including a copy of the communication they wish to transmit, the trustee must either grant them access to the information or inform them of the approximate number of bondholders and the cost of mailing the communication. If the trustee chooses not to grant access, they must mail copies of the communication to all bondholders upon written request.

The law emphasizes that the disclosure of this information does not violate any existing or future laws, as long as they do not specifically refer to this section. Trustees are not held accountable for mailing any material in accordance with a request made under this section.

The Bondholders’ lists law was added to the U.S. Code in 1939 and has since been amended in 1990. It falls under Title III, Section 312 of the U.S. Code.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77mmm requires indenture trustees to provide regular reports to indenture security holders. These reports must be transmitted at intervals of no more than 12 months and must contain information about certain events that have occurred within the previous 12 months. Some of the events that must be reported include changes to the indenture trustee's eligibility and qualifications, material changes to relationships specified in the indenture, advances made by the indenture trustee that remain unpaid, changes to other indebtedness owed to the trustee, changes to the property and funds held by the trustee, and any actions taken by the trustee that materially affect the indenture securities or trust estate. 

The indenture trustee is also required to provide additional reports to security holders within specified timeframes. These additional reports must include information about the release or substitution of property subject to the lien of the indenture, as well as any advances made by the trustee since the last report that remain unpaid and exceed 10 percent of the principal amount of indenture securities outstanding. 

The reports must be transmitted by mail to registered holders of indenture securities, as well as to holders who have filed their names and addresses with the trustee. In addition, a copy of each report must be filed with any stock exchange where the indenture securities are listed, as well as with the Commission. 

Overall, these reporting requirements aim to ensure transparency and provide security holders with relevant information about the indenture trustee's activities and any significant events that may impact their investments.

(a) Periodic reportsEach person who, as set forth in the registration statement or application, is or is to be an obligor upon the indenture securities covered thereby shall—
(1)
 file with the indenture trustee copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe) which such obligor is required to file with the Commission pursuant to section 78m or 78o(d) of this title; or, if the obligor is not required to file information, documents, or reports pursuant to either of such sections, then to file with the indenture trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents, and reports which may be required pursuant to section 78m of this title, in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed in such rules and regulations;

(2)
 file with the indenture trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission, such additional information, documents, and reports with respect to compliance by such obligor with the conditions and covenants provided for in the indenture, as may be required by such rules and regulations, including, in the case of annual reports, if required by such rules and regulations, certificates or opinions of independent public accountants, conforming to the requirements of subsection (e) of this section, as to compliance with conditions or covenants, compliance with which is subject to verification by accountants, but no such certificate or opinion shall be required as to any matter specified in clauses (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (3) of subsection (c);

(3)
 transmit to the holders of the indenture securities upon which such person is an obligor, in the manner and to the extent provided in subsection (c) of section 77mmm of this title, such summaries of any information, documents, and reports required to be filed by such obligor pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission; and

(4)
 furnish to the indenture trustee, not less often than annually, a brief certificate from the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of such obligor’s compliance with all conditions and covenants under the indenture. For purposes of this paragraph, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under the indenture.

The rules and regulations prescribed under this subsection shall be such as are necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, having due regard to the types of indentures, and the nature of the business of the class of obligors affected thereby, and the amount of indenture securities outstanding under such indentures, and, in the case of any such rules and regulations prescribed after the indentures to which they apply have been qualified under this subchapter, the additional expense, if any, of complying with such rules and regulations. Such rules and regulations may be prescribed either before or after qualification becomes effective as to any such indenture.

(b) Evidence of recording of indentureIf the indenture to be qualified is or is to be secured by the mortgage or pledge of property, the obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee—
(1)
 promptly after the execution and delivery of the indenture, an opinion of counsel (who may be of counsel for such obligor) either stating that in the opinion of such counsel the indenture has been properly recorded and filed so as to make effective the lien intended to be created thereby, and reciting the details of such action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary to make such lien effective; and

(2)
 at least annually after the execution and delivery of the indenture, an opinion of counsel (who may be of counsel for such obligor) either stating that in the opinion of such counsel such action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording, and refiling of the indenture as is necessary to maintain the lien of such indenture, and reciting the details of such action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary to maintain such lien.


(c) Evidence of compliance with conditions precedentThe obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee evidence of compliance with the conditions precedent, if any, provided for in the indenture (including any covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent) which relate to the authentication and delivery of the indenture securities, to the release or the release and substitution of property subject to the lien of the indenture, to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, or to any other action to be taken by the indenture trustee at the request or upon the application of such obligor. Such evidence shall consist of the following:
(1)
 certificates or opinions made by officers of such obligor who are specified in the indenture, stating that such conditions precedent have been complied with;

(2)
 an opinion of counsel (who may be of counsel for such obligor) stating that in his opinion such conditions precedent have been complied with; and

(3)
 in the case of conditions precedent compliance with which is subject to verification by accountants (such as conditions with respect to the preservation of specified ratios, the amount of net quick assets, negative-pledge clauses, and other similar specific conditions), a certificate or opinion of an accountant, who, in the case of any such conditions precedent to the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, and not otherwise, shall be an independent public accountant selected or approved by the indenture trustee in the exercise of reasonable care, if the aggregate principal amount of such indenture securities and of other indenture securities authenticated and delivered since the commencement of the then current calendar year (other than those with respect to which a certificate or opinion of an accountant is not required, or with respect to which a certificate or opinion of an independent public accountant has previously been furnished) is 10 per centum or more of the aggregate amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding; but no certificate or opinion need be made by any person other than an officer or employee of such obligor who is specified in the indenture, as to (A) dates or periods not covered by annual reports required to be filed by the obligor, in the case of conditions precedent which depend upon a state of facts as of a date or dates or for a period or periods different from that required to be covered by such annual reports, or (B) the amount and value of property additions, except as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (d), or (C) the adequacy of depreciation, maintenance, or repairs.


(d) Certificates of fair valueIf the indenture to be qualified is or is to be secured by the mortgage or pledge of property or securities, the obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee a certificate or opinion of an engineer, appraiser, or other expert as to the fair value—
(1)
 of any property or securities to be released from the lien of the indenture, which certificate or opinion shall state that in the opinion of the person making the same the proposed release will not impair the security under such indenture in contravention of the provisions thereof, and requiring further that such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert, if the fair value of such property or securities and of all other property or securities released since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates or opinions required by this paragraph, is 10 per centum or more of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding; but such a certificate or opinion of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert shall not be required in the case of any release of property or securities, if the fair value thereof as set forth in the certificate or opinion required by this paragraph is less than $25,000 or less than 1 per centum of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding;

(2)
 to such obligor of any securities (other than indenture securities and securities secured by a lien prior to the lien of the indenture upon property subject to the lien of the indenture), the deposit of which with the trustee is to be made the basis for the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, the withdrawal of cash constituting a part of the trust estate or the release of property or securities subject to the lien of the indenture, and requiring further that if the fair value to such obligor of such securities and of all other such securities made the basis of any such authentication and delivery, withdrawal, or release since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates or opinions required by this paragraph, is 10 per centum or more of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding, such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert and, in the case of the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, shall cover the fair value to such obligor of all other such securities so deposited since the commencement of the current calendar year as to which a certificate or opinion of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert has not previously been furnished; but such a certificate of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert shall not be required with respect to any securities so deposited, if the fair value thereof to such obligor as set forth in the certificate or opinion required by this paragraph is less than $25,000 or less than 1 per centum of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding; and

(3) to such obligor of any property the subjection of which to the lien of the indenture is to be made the basis for the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, the withdrawal of cash constituting a part of the trust estate, or the release of property or securities subject to the lien of the indenture, and requiring further that if
(A)
 within six months prior to the date of acquisition thereof by such obligor, such property has been used or operated, by a person or persons other than such obligor, in a business similar to that in which it has been or is to be used or operated by such obligor, and

(B)
 the fair value to such obligor of such property as set forth in such certificate or opinion is not less than $25,000 and not less than 1 per centum of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding,

such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert and, in the case of the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, shall cover the fair value to the obligor of any property so used or operated which has been so subjected to the lien of the indenture since the commencement of the then current calendar year, and as to which a certificate or opinion of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert has not previously been furnished.

The indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that such provision is excluded) to provide that any such certificate or opinion may be made by an officer or employee of the obligor upon the indenture securities who is duly authorized to make such certificate or opinion by the obligor from time to time, except in cases in which this subsection requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent person. In such cases, such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert selected or approved by the indenture trustee in the exercise of reasonable care.

(e) Recitals as to basis of certificate or opinion

Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in the indenture (other than certificates provided pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section) shall include (1) a statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition; (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based; (3) a statement that, in the opinion of such person, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition or covenant has been complied with.


(f) Parties may provide for additional evidence

Nothing in this section shall be construed either as requiring the inclusion in the indenture to be qualified of provisions that the obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee any other evidence of compliance with the conditions and covenants provided for in the indenture than the evidence specified in this section, or as preventing the inclusion of such provisions in such indenture, if the parties so agree.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







In this section of the U.S. Code, it outlines the requirements for obligors (those responsible for the indenture securities) to file reports and provide evidence of compliance with indenture provisions.

The obligor must file annual reports, as well as any other required information, documents, and reports, with the indenture trustee and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If the obligor is not required to file reports with the SEC, they must still file the necessary information with the indenture trustee and the SEC, as prescribed by the Commission's rules and regulations.

The obligor must also provide additional information, documents, and reports related to compliance with the conditions and covenants outlined in the indenture. This may include certificates or opinions from independent public accountants regarding compliance with specific conditions or covenants.

The obligor is also responsible for transmitting summaries of the filed information, documents, and reports to the holders of the indenture securities, as required by the SEC's rules and regulations.

Furthermore, the obligor must provide an annual certificate from their principal executive, financial, or accounting officer, confirming their knowledge of the obligor's compliance with all conditions and covenants under the indenture.

The rules and regulations established by the SEC in relation to these requirements must be in the public interest and protect investors. These regulations may be prescribed before or after the indentures are qualified under this subchapter, taking into account the types of indentures, the nature of the business of the obligors, and the amount of indenture securities outstanding.

If the indenture is secured by property, the obligor must provide the indenture trustee with opinions of counsel stating that the indenture has been properly recorded and filed to create the intended lien. Additionally, the obligor must provide opinions of counsel annually to maintain the lien.

The obligor must also provide evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent outlined in the indenture. This evidence may include certificates or opinions from officers of the obligor, an opinion of counsel, and, in certain cases, certificates or opinions from accountants.

If the indenture is secured by property or securities, the obligor must provide a certificate or opinion from an engineer, appraiser, or other expert regarding the fair value of property or securities to be released from the indenture's lien. This ensures that the proposed release will not impair the security under the indenture. Similar requirements apply to the deposit of securities and the withdrawal of cash or release of property or securities subject to the indenture's lien.

Overall, this section establishes the reporting and compliance requirements for obligors under indenture securities.

(a) Duties prior to defaultThe indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to provide that, prior to default (as such term is defined in such indenture)—
(1)
 the indenture trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties as are specifically set out in such indenture; and

(2)
 the indenture trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, in the absence of bad faith on the part of such trustee, upon certificates or opinions conforming to the requirements of the indenture;

but the indenture trustee shall examine the evidence furnished to it pursuant to section 77nnn of this title to determine whether or not such evidence conforms to the requirements of the indenture.

(b) Notice of defaults

The indenture trustee shall give to the indenture security holders, in the manner and to the extent provided in subsection (c) of section 77mmm of this title, notice of all defaults known to the trustee, within ninety days after the occurrence thereof: Provided, That such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that such provision is excluded) to provide that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any indenture security, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment, the trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors and/or responsible officers, of the trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the indenture security holders.


(c) Duties of the trustee in case of default

The indenture trustee shall exercise in case of default (as such term is defined in such indenture) such of the rights and powers vested in it by such indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.


(d) Responsibility of the trusteeThe indenture to be qualified shall not contain any provisions relieving the indenture trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that—
(1)
 such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain the provisions authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section;

(2)
 such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions protecting the indenture trustee from liability for any error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer or officers of such trustee, unless it shall be proved that such trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(3)
 such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions protecting the indenture trustee with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding (determined as provided in subsection (a) of section 77ppp of this title) relating to the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to such trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon such trustee, under such indenture.


(e) Undertaking for costs

The indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions to the effect that all parties thereto, including the indenture security holders, agree that the court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under such indenture, or in any suit against the trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant: Provided, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any suit instituted by such trustee, to any suit instituted by any indenture security holder, or group of indenture security holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10 per centum in principal amount of the indenture securities outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any indenture security holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security.

The 15 U.S. Code § 77ooo outlines the duties and responsibilities of the trustee in a qualified indenture. 

Prior to default, the trustee is generally not liable for any duties except those specifically set out in the indenture. The trustee can rely on certificates or opinions, as long as they conform to the requirements of the indenture. However, the trustee must examine the evidence provided to ensure it meets the requirements of the indenture.

If a default occurs, the trustee must give notice of the default to the indenture security holders within ninety days of the occurrence, unless it is determined by the board of directors or a trust committee that withholding the notice is in the best interests of the security holders.

In the case of a default, the trustee must exercise the rights and powers vested in it by the indenture with the same degree of care and skill as a prudent person would use in their own affairs.

The trustee cannot be relieved of liability for its own negligent actions, failure to act, or willful misconduct. However, the indenture can contain provisions protecting the trustee from liability for errors of judgment made in good faith by responsible officers, as long as the trustee was not negligent in ascertaining the facts. The indenture can also protect the trustee for actions taken or not taken in accordance with the direction of the majority of the indenture security holders.

The indenture must also contain provisions stating that the court may require parties in any suit related to the indenture to pay costs, and that reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, may be assessed against any party in the suit based on the merits and good faith of their claims or defenses. However, this provision does not apply to suits initiated by the trustee or certain large indenture security holders, or suits for the enforcement of payment of principal or interest on indenture securities.

This section of the U.S. Code was added in 1939 and has been subsequently amended. The most recent amendment was in 1990.

(a) Directions and waivers by bondholdersThe indenture to be qualified—
(1)
 shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions authorizing the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the indenture securities or if expressly specified in such indenture, of any series of securities at the time outstanding (A) to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to such trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon such trustee, under such indenture, or (B) on behalf of the holders of all such indenture securities, to consent to the waiver of any past default and its consequences; or

(2)
 may contain provisions authorizing the holders of not less than 75 per centum in principal amount of the indenture securities or if expressly specified in such indenture, of any series of securities at the time outstanding to consent on behalf of the holders of all such indenture securities to the postponement of any interest payment for a period not exceeding three years from its due date.

For the purposes of this subsection and paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of section 77ooo of this title, in determining whether the holders of the required principal amount of indenture securities have concurred in any such direction or consent, indenture securities owned by any obligor upon the indenture securities, or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with any such obligor, shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the indenture trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction or consent, only indenture securities which such trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

(b) Prohibition of impairment of holder’s right to paymentNotwithstanding any other provision of the indenture to be qualified, the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder, except—
(1)
 as to a postponement of an interest payment consented to as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (a);

(2)
 that such indenture may contain provisions limiting or denying the right of any such holder to institute any such suit, if and to the extent that the institution or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under applicable law, result in the surrender, impairment, waiver, or loss of the lien of such indenture upon any property subject to such lien; and

(3)
 that the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security shall not be deemed to be impaired or affected by any change occurring by the application of section 5803 of title 12 to any indenture security.


(c) Record date

The obligor upon any indenture qualified under this subchapter may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of indenture security holders entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted by subsection (a) of this section. Unless the indenture provides otherwise, such record date shall be the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of holders furnished to the trustee pursuant to section 77lll of this title prior to such solicitation.

Summary:

The 15 U.S. Code § 77ppp outlines provisions regarding directions and waivers by bondholders, the prohibition of impairment of a holder's right to payment, and the establishment of a record date. 

According to the code, the indenture (a legal agreement between the issuer of a bond and the bondholders) shall include provisions that authorize bondholders to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding or to consent to the waiver of any past default and its consequences. This provision applies to holders of a majority in principal amount of the indenture securities, or a specified percentage if specified in the indenture.

Additionally, the indenture may contain provisions that allow bondholders to consent to the postponement of interest payments for a period not exceeding three years. This provision applies to holders of a specified percentage, typically 75% in principal amount.

The code also states that the right of any bondholder to receive payment of the principal and interest on their bond, or to institute a lawsuit for payment, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the bondholder. However, there are exceptions, such as the postponement of interest payments as mentioned earlier, and provisions in the indenture that limit or deny the right of a bondholder to sue if it would result in the surrender or impairment of the lien on the underlying property.

Furthermore, the obligor (the entity responsible for making payments on the bonds) may set a record date to determine the identity of bondholders entitled to vote or consent to any action authorized by the code. This record date is typically set 30 days prior to the first solicitation of consent.

Overall, the code aims to protect the rights of bondholders and ensure that their ability to receive payment is not impaired without their consent.

Note: Amendments have been made to this code over time, with the most recent amendment occurring in 2022.

The 15 U.S. Code § 77qqq outlines the special powers and duties of a trustee and paying agents in relation to indenture securities. 

According to the code, the trustee has the authority to take legal action against the obligor (the borrower) in the event of a default in payment of the principal or interest on the securities. The trustee can file necessary documents and proofs of claim to protect the interests of the indenture security holders in any legal proceedings involving the obligor.

On the other hand, the paying agent is responsible for holding and managing the funds meant for the payment of principal and interest on the indenture securities. They are required to notify the trustee of any default in the obligor's payment.

This code was added in 1939 and has been amended in 1990 and 2010.

The provisions of sections 77jjj to and including 77qqq of this title that impose duties on any person (including provisions automatically deemed included in an indenture unless the indenture provides that such provisions are excluded) are a part of and govern every qualified indenture, whether or not physically contained therein, shall be deemed retroactively to govern each indenture heretofore qualified, and prospectively to govern each indenture hereafter qualified under this subchapter and shall be deemed retroactively to amend and supersede inconsistent provisions in each such indenture heretofore qualified. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not be deemed to effect the inclusion (by retroactive amendment or otherwise) in the text of any indenture heretofore qualified of any of the optional provisions contemplated by section 77jjj(b)(1), 77kkk(b), 77nnn(d), 77ooo(a), 77ooo(b), 77ooo(d), 77ooo(e), or 77ppp(a)(1) of this title.


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 318, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1173; amended Pub. L. 101–550, title IV, § 417, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2731.)







Editorial Notes
Amendments
1990—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 101–550, § 417(1), added subsec. (a) and struck out former subsec. (a) which read as follows: “The indenture to be qualified shall provide that if any provision thereof limits, qualifies, or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in such indenture by any of sections 77jjj to 77qqq of this title, inclusive, such required provision shall control.”
Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 101–550, § 417(2), added subsec. (c).







The 15 U.S. Code § 77rrr, also known as the "Effect of prescribed indenture provisions," outlines the impact of certain provisions in indentures that are required to be qualified under this subchapter.

According to subsection (a), if any provision in the indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with the duties imposed by subsection (c), the imposed duties shall take precedence.

Subsection (b) states that the indenture may include additional provisions that are not in violation of any provision in this subchapter, in addition to the provisions specifically authorized to be included.

Subsection (c) clarifies that the provisions of sections 77jjj to 77qqq, which impose duties on individuals, are applicable to every qualified indenture, regardless of whether they are physically included in the indenture. These provisions are retroactively applicable to previously qualified indentures and prospectively applicable to future qualified indentures. However, they do not affect the inclusion of optional provisions mentioned in section 77jjj(b)(1), 77kkk(b), 77nnn(d), 77ooo(a), 77ooo(b), 77ooo(d), 77ooo(e), or 77ppp(a)(1).

The amendment made in 1990 introduced the current subsection (a), which replaced the previous subsection (a) and clarified that required provisions in the indenture shall control over conflicting provisions.

Overall, this code section establishes the hierarchy of provisions in qualified indentures and ensures that the prescribed duties and provisions take precedence over conflicting ones.

The 15 U.S. Code § 77sss establishes the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create, modify, and rescind rules, regulations, and orders for the purpose of protecting investors and promoting the public interest. This includes the power to define accounting, technical, and trade terms used in the subchapter.

The SEC is authorized to prescribe methods for calculating percentages of voting securities and other securities in indentures, as well as define the terms "cash transaction" and "self-liquidating paper" in indentures. The definitions provided by the SEC must consider the public interest and investor protection.

The SEC also has the authority to prescribe the form or forms in which information required in any statement, application, report, or other document filed with the Commission must be presented.

The rules and regulations issued by the SEC under this subchapter are effective upon publication, as determined by the Commission. Any act done in good faith in compliance with the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission is exempt from liability, even if those rules, regulations, or orders are later amended, rescinded, or deemed invalid.

Overall, this code section grants the SEC broad authority to create and enforce regulations to ensure compliance with securities laws and protect the interests of investors.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.


Exception as to Transfer of Functions
Functions vested by any provision of law in Comptroller of the Currency, referred to in this section, not included in transfer of functions of officers, agencies and employees of Department of the Treasury to Secretary of the Treasury, made by Reorg. Plan No. 26 of 1950, § 1, eff. July 31, 1950, 15 F.R. 4935, 64 Stat. 1280. See section 321(c)(2) of Title 31, Money and Finance.







This section of the U.S. Code outlines the special powers granted to the Commission (presumably the Securities and Exchange Commission) for the purpose of investigating and enforcing regulations related to this particular subchapter.

The Commission, or any designated officer, has the power to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of relevant records and documents. They can require witnesses and the production of records from anywhere in the United States or any territory.

The Commission also has the authority to request reports, records, and other information from various government offices and agencies such as the Treasury Department, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. These offices can also conduct examinations of trustees or prospective trustees under qualified indentures and provide their findings to the Commission upon request.

However, the Commission is restricted from disclosing any reports, records, or information obtained from these sources to anyone other than Commission members, officers, agents, or employees. There is an exception that allows the Commission to share certain information with the Attorney General of the United States in confidence if it is necessary for the performance of their duties.

The investigation of prospective trustees is limited to determining their qualification and eligibility under the relevant provisions of this subchapter. The Commission can require the inclusion of information about the trustee's eligibility in registration statements or applications and can also require the inclusion of the trustee's most recent published report of condition, or determine their eligibility based on other criteria if the indenture does not contain the specific provision mentioned.

The section also addresses the appointment and compensation of Commission employees and the leasing and allocation of necessary real property.

This section was added to the U.S. Code in 1939 and was subsequently amended in 1990. The transfer of functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission is mentioned, as well as exceptions to the transfer of functions of the Comptroller of the Currency.

(a)
 Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed with the Commission pursuant to any provisions of this subchapter, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or who shall omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading or of such omission) who, in reliance upon such statement or omission, shall have purchased or sold a security issued under the indenture to which such application, report, or document relates, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading or of such omission. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the suit or defense. No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







The 15 U.S. Code § 77www, also known as the Liability for misleading statements, is a provision in the U.S. Code that holds individuals accountable for making false or misleading statements in applications, reports, or documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

According to this provision, if a person makes a false or misleading statement or omits a material fact in such filings, and another person purchases or sells a security based on such statement or omission, the person who made the false or misleading statement can be held liable for any damages caused by the reliance on that statement or omission. However, it is important to note that the person being sued can defend themselves by proving that they acted in good faith and had no knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.

The provision also allows the person seeking to enforce this liability to sue in any court of competent jurisdiction, either at law or in equity. The court has the discretion to require the payment of costs and may assess reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees, against either party based on the merits and good faith of the suit or defense.

It is important to bring any action to enforce this liability within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after the cause of action accrued.

This provision does not limit any other rights and remedies available under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any other laws or legal principles. However, the person suing for damages under this provision cannot recover more than their actual damages resulting from the act complained of.

It is worth noting that this provision was added to the U.S. Code in 1939 and has been amended in 2010 to include specific references to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

It shall be unlawful for any person in offering, selling or issuing any security to represent or imply in any manner whatsoever that any action or failure to act by the Commission in the administration of this subchapter means that the Commission has in any way passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, any trustee, indenture or security, or any transaction or transactions therein, or that any such action or failure to act with regard to any statement or report filed with or examined by the Commission pursuant to this subchapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, has the effect of a finding by the Commission that such statement or report is true and accurate on its face or that it is not false or misleading.

Transfer of Functions
For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, §§ 1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265, set out under section 78d of this title.







This section of the U.S. Code, titled "Unlawful representations," makes it illegal for anyone offering, selling, or issuing securities to suggest or imply that any action or inaction by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) means that the Commission has endorsed or approved any trustee, indenture, security, transaction, statement, report, or any other related matter.

The section was added to the U.S. Code on August 3, 1939, and was later amended on August 10, 1954. The 1954 amendment replaced the phrase "issuing or selling" with "offering, selling, or issuing."

It is important to note that this section does not provide a detailed explanation of the specific penalties or consequences for violating this law. However, it is generally understood that individuals or entities found guilty of making unlawful representations may face legal and financial consequences.

It is also worth mentioning that the transfer of functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Chairman of the Commission is addressed in the section. This transfer was made in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950, which took effect on May 24, 1950.

Overall, this section of the U.S. Code aims to prevent misleading or false representations about the SEC's actions or approvals in relation to securities and related matters.

The U.S. Code, specifically 15 U.S. Code § 77zzz, states that unless otherwise specified, this subchapter (which likely refers to a specific section of the U.S. Code) does not affect the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It also does not affect the rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities of any person under these acts. 

Furthermore, this subchapter does not impact the jurisdiction of any other commission, board, agency, or officer of the United States or any State or political subdivision of any State, as long as that jurisdiction does not conflict with any provision of this subchapter or any rule, regulation, or order under it.

The note also mentions that the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are acts that are classified under the U.S. Code. The specific references to these acts provide further context to the jurisdiction and rights mentioned earlier.

There was an amendment in 2010 that substituted the mention of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 with the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The note also includes information about the effective date of the 2010 amendment and references a transfer of functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Chairman of the Commission.

If any provision of this subchapter or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of the subchapter and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid shall not be affected thereby.

(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 328, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1177.)










This section of the U.S. Code, specifically 15 U.S. Code § 77bbbb, is titled "Separability" and discusses the impact of invalidation of any provision within the subchapter or its application to any person or circumstance.

According to this section, if any provision within this subchapter or its application to a specific person or circumstance is deemed invalid, it will not affect the remainder of the subchapter or its application to other persons or circumstances.

This means that even if a certain provision is found to be invalid, the rest of the subchapter will still remain in effect and applicable to other situations. The intention behind this section is to ensure that the invalidation of one provision does not render the entire subchapter useless.

The language of this section suggests that it was added to the U.S. Code on August 3, 1939, as part of the Securities Act of 1933. Its purpose is to provide legal protection and maintain the overall effectiveness of the subchapter in regulating securities and related matters.

Overall, the "Separability" section emphasizes the importance of preserving the functionality of the subchapter and ensuring that the invalidation of one provision does not undermine the validity of the entire subchapter or its application to other persons or circumstances.
