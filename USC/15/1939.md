(a) Practices adversely affecting publicUpon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the Securities and Exchange Commission made to the Congress pursuant to section 78jj of this title and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is hereby declared that the national public interest and the interest of investors in notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certificates of interest or participation therein, which are offered to the public, are adversely affected—
(1)
 when the obligor fails to provide a trustee to protect and enforce the rights and to represent the interests of such investors, notwithstanding the fact that (A) individual action by such investors for the purpose of protecting and enforcing their rights is rendered impracticable by reason of the disproportionate expense of taking such action, and (B) concerted action by such investors in their common interest through representatives of their own selection is impeded by reason of the wide dispersion of such investors through many States, and by reason of the fact that information as to the names and addresses of such investors generally is not available to such investors;

(2)
 when the trustee does not have adequate rights and powers, or adequate duties and responsibilities, in connection with matters relating to the protection and enforcement of the rights of such investors; when, notwithstanding the obstacles to concerted action by such investors, and the general and reasonable assumption by such investors that the trustee is under an affirmative duty to take action for the protection and enforcement of their rights, trust indentures (A) generally provide that the trustee shall be under no duty to take any such action, even in the event of default, unless it receives notice of default, demand for action, and indemnity, from the holders of substantial percentages of the securities outstanding thereunder, and (B) generally relieve the trustee from liability even for its own negligent action or failure to act;

(3)
 when the trustee does not have resources commensurate with its responsibilities, or has any relationship to or connection with the obligor or any underwriter of any securities of the obligor, or holds, beneficially or otherwise, any interest in the obligor or any such underwriter, which relationship, connection, or interest involves a material conflict with the interests of such investors;

(4)
 when the obligor is not obligated to furnish to the trustee under the indenture and to such investors adequate current information as to its financial condition, and as to the performance of its obligations with respect to the securities outstanding under such indenture; or when the communication of such information to such investors is impeded by the fact that information as to the names and addresses of such investors generally is not available to the trustee and to such investors;

(5)
 when the indenture contains provisions which are misleading or deceptive, or when full and fair disclosure is not made to prospective investors of the effect of important indenture provisions; or

(6)
 when, by reason of the fact that trust indentures are commonly prepared by the obligor or underwriter in advance of the public offering of the securities to be issued thereunder, such investors are unable to participate in the preparation thereof, and, by reason of their lack of understanding of the situation, such investors would in any event be unable to procure the correction of the defects enumerated in this subsection.


(b) Declaration of policy

Practices of the character above enumerated have existed to such an extent that, unless regulated, the public offering of notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certificates of interest or participation therein, by the use of means and instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce and of the mails, is injurious to the capital markets, to investors, and to the general public; and it is hereby declared to be the policy of this subchapter, in accordance with which policy all the provisions of this subchapter shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and eliminate the practices, enumerated in this section, connected with such public offerings.


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 302, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1150.)

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77bbb -  Necessity for regulation 


This section of U.S. law discusses the necessity for the regulation of securities, particularly notes, bonds, and other forms of indebtedness. It outlines the negative impacts on public interest and on investors when, for example, an obligor doesn't provide a trustee to protect investors' interests, when the trustee doesn't have adequate rights and powers, or when the obligor fails to provide sufficient financial information. It also discusses the negative impacts of misleading or deceptive indenture provisions and of investors not being able to participate in the preparation of trust indentures. The second part of this section declares that these practices have been so harmful that regulation is essential to protect investors and the general public, and to ensure the health of the capital markets. The law was enacted as part of the efforts to improve the transparency and integrity of the U.S. financial system following the Great Depression.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77ccc -  Definitions 


This section provides definitions for terms used in a subchapter of the U.S. code related to securities and trading. It includes terms such as "sale", "underwriter", "director", "executive officer", "indenture", and "Commission", among others. 

For example, the term "underwriter" is defined as any person who purchases from an issuer with the intention of distributing the security, or participating in its distribution. However, this term does not include a person whose involvement is limited to receiving a commission from an underwriter or dealer.

The term "Commission" refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the term "Bankruptcy Act" refers to the Bankruptcy Act or title 11.

The Code also specifies that terms defined in the Securities Act of 1933 and not otherwise defined in this section will carry the meanings assigned in the Securities Act of 1933.

This is a significant piece of legislation that provides legal clarity for those involved in the securities industry, and is frequently referred to in cases involving trading and securities.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77ddd -  Exempted securities and transactions 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the types of securities and transactions that are exempt from certain provisions within the subchapter. These include, but are not limited to, certain types of notes, bonds, debentures or evidences of indebtedness, securities exempted from the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, securities issued under a mortgage indenture with a contract of insurance under the National Housing Act, and securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign government or subdivision therein.

It also notes that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the power to exempt any person, registration statement, indenture, security or transaction from any one or more of the provisions of the subchapter if such exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.

Lastly, the SEC can add to the securities exempted as provided in this section any class of securities issued by a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, if it is found that enforcement of this subchapter with respect to such securities is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors. 

This code appears to have been updated and amended multiple times, with the most recent amendment in 2010.

##  15 U.S. Code § 77eee -  Securities required to be registered under Securities Act 







                        U.S. Code 



                        Notes 




prev | next





(a) Information requiredSubject to the provisions of section 77ddd of this title, a registration statement relating to a security shall include the following information and documents, as though such inclusion were required by the provisions of section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77g]—
(1)
 such information and documents as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe in order to enable the Commission to determine whether any person designated to act as trustee under the indenture under which such security has been or is to be issued is eligible to act as such under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title; and

(2)
 an analysis of any provisions of such indenture with respect to (A) the definition of what shall constitute a default under such indenture, and the withholding of notice to the indenture security holders of any such default, (B) the authentication and delivery of the indenture securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, (C) the release or the release and substitution of any property subject to the lien of the indenture, (D) the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, and (E) the evidence required to be furnished by the obligor upon the indenture securities to the trustee as to compliance with the conditions and covenants provided for in such indenture.

The information and documents required by paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to the person designated to act as indenture trustee shall be contained in a separate part of such registration statement, which part shall be signed by such person. Such part of the registration statement shall be deemed to be a document filed pursuant to this subchapter, and the provisions of sections 11, 12, 17, and 24 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77k, 77l, 77q, 77x] shall not apply to statements therein or omissions therefrom.

(b) Refusal of registration statement
(1) Except as may be permitted by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission shall issue an order prior to the effective date of registration refusing to permit such a registration statement to become effective, if it finds that—
(A)
 the security to which such registration statement relates has not been or is not to be issued under an indenture; or

(B)
 any person designated as trustee under such indenture is not eligible to act as such under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title;

but no such order shall be issued except after notice and opportunity for hearing within the periods and in the manner required with respect to refusal orders pursuant to section 8(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h(b)]. If and when the Commission deems that the objections on which such order was based have been met, the Commission shall enter an order rescinding such refusal order, and the registration shall become effective at the time provided in section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h(a)], or upon the date of such rescission, whichever shall be the later.

(2)
 In the case of securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], which securities are eligible to be issued, offered, or sold on a delayed basis by or on behalf of the registrant, the Commission shall not be required to issue an order pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section for failure to designate a trustee eligible to act under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title if, in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Commission, the issuer of such securities files an application for the purpose of determining such trustee’s eligibility under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title. The Commission shall issue an order prior to the effective date of such application refusing to permit the application to become effective, if it finds that any person designated as trustee under such indenture is not eligible to act as such under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title, but no order shall be issued except after notice and opportunity for hearing within the periods and in the manner required with respect to refusal orders pursuant to section 8(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77h(b)]. If after notice and opportunity for hearing the Commission issues an order under this provision, the obligor shall within 5 calendar days appoint a trustee meeting the requirements of subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title. No such appointment shall be effective and such refusal order shall not be rescinded by the Commission until a person eligible to act as trustee under subsection (a) of section 77jjj of this title has been appointed. If no order is issued, an application filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective the tenth day after filing thereof or such earlier date as the Commission may determine, having due regard to the adequacy of information provided therein, the public interest, and the protection of investors.


(c) Information required in prospectus

A prospectus relating to any such security shall include to the extent the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations as necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, as though such inclusion were required by section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77j], a written statement containing the analysis set forth in the registration statement, of any indenture provisions with respect to the matters specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, together with a supplementary analysis, prepared by the Commission, of such provisions and of the effect thereof, if, in the opinion of the Commission, the inclusion of such supplementary analysis is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and the Commission so declares by order after notice and, if demanded by the issuer, opportunity for hearing thereon. Such order shall be entered prior to the effective date of registration, except that if opportunity for hearing thereon is demanded by the issuer such order shall be entered within a reasonable time after such opportunity for hearing.


(d) Applicability of other statutory provisions

The provisions of sections 11, 12, 17, and 24 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77k, 77l, 77q, 77x], and the provisions of sections 77www and 77yyy of this title, shall not apply to statements in or omissions from any analysis required under the provisions of this section or section 77fff or 77ggg of this title.


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 305, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1154; amended Aug. 10, 1954, ch. 667, title III, § 303, 68 Stat. 687; Pub. L. 101–550, title IV, § 404, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2722.)

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77eee -  Securities required to be registered under Securities Act 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the registration requirements for securities under the Securities Act. It stipulates what information should be included in a registration statement such as details relating to the indenture trustee and any provisions in the indenture regarding defaults, authentication and delivery of the securities, release of property under the lien of the indenture, and satisfaction and discharge of the indenture. 

It also allows the Commission to refuse a registration statement if the security has not been or is not to be issued under an indenture, or if the person acting as trustee is ineligible. The issuer has a right to a hearing before such an order is issued.

Furthermore, a prospectus relating to the security must contain an analysis of the indenture provisions and a supplementary analysis by the Commission if deemed necessary. 

The section also states that certain provisions of the Securities Act and sections of this title do not apply to omissions or statements from any analysis required under this section.

The law was last amended in 1990, which removed the requirement for the Commission to check for conflicting interests in the appointed trustee. The amendment also allowed for certain securities to be issued on a delayed basis. 

In short, this law outlines what information must be included in a security's registration statement, the conditions under which the Commission can refuse a registration statement, and what is required in a prospectus.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77fff -  Securities not registered under Securities Act 


This U.S. law, titled 15 U.S. Code § 77fff - Securities not registered under Securities Act, makes it illegal for anyone to sell, deliver, or offer to sell securities that are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, unless they are issued under an indenture and an application for qualification is effective.

The law is broken down into three subsections:

(a) Prohibitions affecting unregistered securities not issued under indenture: This section makes it illegal for anyone to sell or deliver such securities through means of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or through the mail.

(b) Prohibitions affecting unregistered securities issued under indenture: This section makes it illegal for anyone to carry or transmit any prospectus relating to such security unless the prospectus includes or is accompanied by a written statement that contains specific information. It also makes it illegal to carry or deliver such security for sale unless it is accompanied by a written statement that contains specific information.

(c) Necessity of issuance under indenture; application for qualification: This section makes it illegal for anyone to offer to sell such security unless it has been or is to be issued under an indenture and an application for qualification has been filed.

The law was added on August 3, 1939 and later amended on August 10, 1954. The amendment in 1954 gave the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to prescribe the extent to which summaries of indenture provisions must be used in the sale of specified types of securities.

The law is part of the U.S. Code’s regulations on securities and trust indentures, which are designed to protect investors and maintain fair and efficient markets.

Subject to the provisions of section 77uuu of this title, the information and documents contained in or filed with any application shall be made available to the public under such regulations as the Commission may prescribe, and copies thereof, photostatic or otherwise, shall be furnished to every applicant therefor at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77ggg -  Qualification of indentures covering securities not required to be registered 


This section of the U.S. Code (15 U.S. Code § 77ggg) discusses the qualification process for indentures related to securities not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The issuer of such security must apply for qualification of the indenture, detailing information and documents as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information must be made available to the public and copies provided to applicants. An application can be withdrawn before its effective date.

The application's filing is considered complete upon receipt by the Commission. The application process is subject to the same provisions as a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933. 

In 2002, there was an amendment to subsection (b), removing the requirement for a $100 filing fee to be paid in specific ways, such as in cash or by a United States postal money order.

In summary, this section provides guidelines for how issuers of certain types of securities should go about applying for qualification of indentures, the information required for such applications, the application process, and the public availability of such information. It also outlines the implications of withdrawing an application and the legal provisions applicable to such applications.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77hhh -  Integration of procedure with Securities Act and other Acts 


This section of the U.S. Code, under Title 15, relates to the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) power to authorize the filing of documents and information by incorporating by reference any documents already on file with the SEC (subsection (a)), and provides for the consolidation of applications, reports, and proceedings with other related financial acts such as the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (subsection (b)). 

The code essentially grants the SEC the power to streamline and integrate the procedures and processes under this subchapter with those of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which forms the basis of federal securities law in the United States. This ensures a more effective and efficient regulatory framework, which is considered necessary for the public interest and for the protection of investors.

In 2010, the act was amended to remove references to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This amendment came into effect one day after July 21, 2010.

In simpler terms, this law allows the SEC to simplify and consolidate the paperwork related to securities filings, making it easier for companies to comply with regulations and for investors to access necessary information.

 when an application for the qualification of such indenture becomes effective, pursuant to section 77ggg of this title.


(b) Stop orders after effective time of qualification

After qualification has become effective as to the indenture under which a security has been or is to be issued, no stop order shall be issued pursuant to section 77h(d) of this title, suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to such security or of the application for qualification of such indenture, except on one or more of the grounds specified in section 77h of this title, or the failure of the issuer to file an application as provided for by section 77eee(b)(2) of this title.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77iii -  Effective time of qualification 


This U.S. Code, 15 U.S. Code § 77iii, governs the qualification of indentures, which are legal contracts between bond issuers and bondholders. It outlines when an indenture becomes effective, rules for issuing stop orders, the effect of subsequent regulations, the liability of the trustee, and the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate.

The indenture becomes effective either when the registration of the security becomes effective or when the application for qualification of the indenture itself becomes effective.

Once the indenture is effective, stop orders to suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement or the application for qualification can only be issued on grounds specified in section 77h of this title, or if the issuer fails to file an application as required.

Future changes to rules, regulations, or orders do not affect indentures that have already become effective, unless specified by section 77nnn.

Trustees under an effective indenture are protected from liability due to non-compliance with provisions of this subchapter, or any rule or regulation thereunder.

The SEC is not authorized to investigate or enforce compliance with the provisions of an indenture.

This law was initially enacted in 1933, then amended in 1939 and 1990. The 1990 amendment expanded the grounds for issuing stop orders.

                        U.S. Code 



                        Notes

(a) Persons eligible for appointment as trustee
(1)
 There shall at all times be one or more trustees under every indenture qualified or to be qualified pursuant to this subchapter, at least one of whom shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State or Territory or of the District of Columbia or a corporation or other person permitted to act as trustee by the Commission (referred to in this subchapter as the institutional trustee), which (A) is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and (B) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State, Territorial, or District of Columbia authority. The Commission may, pursuant to such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, or by order on application, permit a corporation or other person organized and doing business under the laws of a foreign government to act as sole trustee under an indenture qualified or to be qualified pursuant to this subchapter, if such corporation or other person (i) is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, and (ii) is subject to supervision or examination by authority of such foreign government or a political subdivision thereof substantially equivalent to supervision or examination applicable to United States institutional trustees. In prescribing such rules and regulations or making such order, the Commission shall consider whether under such laws, a United States institutional trustee is eligible to act as sole trustee under an indenture relating to securities sold within the jurisdiction of such foreign government.

(2)
 Such institution [1] trustee shall have at all times a combined capital and surplus of a specified minimum amount, which shall not be less than $150,000. If such institutional trustee publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, the indenture may provide that, for the purposes of this paragraph, the combined capital and surplus of such trustee shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

(3)
 If the indenture to be qualified requires or permits the appointment of one or more co-trustees in addition to such institutional trustee, the rights, powers, duties, and obligations conferred or imposed upon the trustees or any of them shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by such institutional trustee, or such institutional trustee and such co-trustees jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, such institutional trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties, and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustees.

(4)
 In the case of certificates of interest or participation, the indenture trustee or trustees shall have the legal power to exercise all of the rights, powers, and privileges of a holder of the security or securities in which such certificates evidence an interest or participation.

(5)
 No obligor upon the indenture securities or person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such obligor shall serve as trustee upon such indenture securities.


(b) Disqualification of trusteeIf any indenture trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting interest as hereinafter defined—
(i)
 then, within 90 days after ascertaining that it has such conflicting interest, and if the default (as defined in the next sentence) to which such conflicting interest relates has not been cured or duly waived or otherwise eliminated before the end of such 90-day period, such trustee shall either eliminate such conflicting interest or, except as otherwise provided below in this subsection, resign, and the obligor upon the indenture securities shall take prompt steps to have a successor appointed in the manner provided in the indenture;

(ii)
 in the event that such trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of clause (i) of this subsection, such trustee shall, within 10 days after the expiration of such 90-day period, transmit notice of such failure to the indenture security holders in the manner and to the extent provided in subsection (c) of section 77mmm of this title; and

(iii)
 subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of section 77ooo of this title, unless such trustee’s duty to resign is stayed as provided below in this subsection, any security holder who has been a bona fide holder of indenture securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of such trustee, and the appointment of a successor, if such trustee fails, after written request thereof by such holder to comply with the provisions of clause (i) of this subsection.

For the purposes of this subsection, an indenture trustee shall be deemed to have a conflicting interest if the indenture securities are in default (as such term is defined in such indenture, but exclusive of any period of grace or requirement of notice) and—
(1) such trustee is trustee under another indenture under which any other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in any other securities, of an obligor upon the indenture securities are outstanding or is trustee for more than one outstanding series of securities, as hereafter defined, under a single indenture of an obligor, unless—
(A)
 the indenture securities are collateral trust notes under which the only collateral consists of securities issued under such other indenture,

(B)
 such other indenture is a collateral trust indenture under which the only collateral consists of indenture securities, or

(C)
 such obligor has no substantial unmortgaged assets and is engaged primarily in the business of owning, or of owning and developing and/or operating, real estate, and the indenture to be qualified and such other indenture are secured by wholly separate and distinct parcels of real estate:

Provided, That the indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that such provision is excluded) to contain a provision excluding from the operation of this paragraph other series under such indenture, and any other indenture or indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest or participation in other securities, of such an obligor are outstanding, if—
(i)
 the indenture to be qualified and any such other indenture or indentures (and all series of securities issuable thereunder) are wholly unsecured and rank equally, and such other indenture or indentures (and such series) are specifically described in the indenture to be qualified or are thereafter qualified under this subchapter, unless the Commission shall have found and declared by order pursuant to subsection (b) of section 77eee of this title or subsection (c) of section 77ggg of this title that differences exist between the provisions of the indenture (or such series) to be qualified and the provisions of such other indenture or indentures (or such series) which are so likely to involve a material conflict of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors to disqualify such trustee from acting as such under one of such indentures, or

(ii)
 the issuer shall have sustained the burden of proving, on application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that trusteeship under the indenture to be qualified and such other indenture or under more than one outstanding series under a single indenture is not so likely to involve a material conflict of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors to disqualify such trustee from acting as such under one of such indentures or with respect to such series;


(2)
 such trustee or any of its directors or executive officers is an underwriter for an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(3)
 such trustee directly or indirectly controls or is directly or indirectly controlled by or is under direct or indirect common control with an underwriter for an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(4) such trustee or any of its directors or executive officers is a director, officer, partner, employee, appointee, or representative of an obligor upon the indenture securities, or of an underwriter (other than the trustee itself) for such an obligor who is currently engaged in the business of underwriting, except that—
(A)
 one individual may be a director and/or an executive officer of the trustee and a director and/or an executive officer of such obligor, but may not be at the same time an executive officer of both the trustee and of such obligor,

(B)
 if and so long as the number of directors of the trustee in office is more than nine, one additional individual may be a director and/or an executive officer of the trustee and a director of such obligor, and

(C)
 such trustee may be designated by any such obligor or by any underwriter for any such obligor, to act in the capacity of transfer agent, registrar, custodian, paying agent, fiscal agent, escrow agent, or depositary, or in any other similar capacity, or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, to act as trustee, whether under an indenture or otherwise;


(5)
 10 per centum or more of the voting securities of such trustee is beneficially owned either by an obligor upon the indenture securities or by any director, partner or executive officer thereof, or 20 per centum or more of such voting securities is beneficially owned, collectively by any two or more of such persons; or 10 per centum or more of the voting securities of such trustee is beneficially owned either by an underwriter for any such obligor or by any director, partner, or executive officer thereof, or is beneficially owned, collectively, by any two or more such persons;

(6) such trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral security for an obligation which is in default as hereinafter defined—
(A)
 5 per centum or more of the voting securities, or 10 per centum or more of any other class of security, of an obligor upon the indenture securities, not including indentures [2] securities and securities issued under any other indenture under which such trustee is also trustee, or

(B)
 10 per centum or more of any class of security of an underwriter for any such obligor;


(7)
 such trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral security for an obligation which is in default as hereinafter defined, 5 per centum or more of the voting securities of any person who, to the knowledge of the trustee, owns 10 per centum or more of the voting securities of, or controls directly or indirectly or is under direct or indirect common control with, an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(8)
 such trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral security for an obligation which is in default as hereinafter defined, 10 per centum or more of any class of security of any person who, to the knowledge of the trustee, owns 50 per centum or more of the voting securities of an obligor upon the indenture securities;

(9)
 such trustee owns, on the date of default upon the indenture securities (as such term is defined in such indenture but exclusive of any period of grace or requirement of notice) or any anniversary of such default while such default upon the indenture securities remains outstanding, in the capacity of executor, administrator, testamentary or inter vivos trustee, guardian, committee or conservator, or in any other similar capacity, an aggregate of 25 per centum or more of the voting securities, or of any class of security, of any person, the beneficial ownership of a specified percentage of which would have constituted a conflicting interest under paragraph (6), (7), or (8) of this subsection. As to any such securities of which the indenture trustee acquired ownership through becoming executor, administrator or testamentary trustee of an estate which include them, the provisions of the preceding sentence shall not apply for a period of not more than 2 years from the date of such acquisition, to the extent that such securities included in such estate do not exceed 25 per centum of such voting securities or 25 per centum of any such class of security. Promptly after the dates of any such default upon the indenture securities and annually in each succeeding year that the indenture securities remain in default the trustee shall make a check of its holding of such securities in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of such dates. If the obligor upon the indenture securities fails to make payment in full of principal or interest under such indenture when and as the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for 30 days thereafter, the trustee shall make a prompt check of its holdings of such securities in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of the date of the expiration of such 30-day period, and after such date, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, all such securities so held by the trustee, with sole or joint control over such securities vested in it, shall be considered as though beneficially owned by such trustee, for the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) of this subsection; or

(10)
 except under the circumstances described in paragraphs [3] (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of section 77kkk(b) of this title, the trustee shall be or shall become a creditor of the obligor.

For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, and of section 77ppp(a) of this title, the term “series of securities” or “series” means a series, class or group of securities issuable under an indenture pursuant to whose terms holders of one such series may vote to direct the indenture trustee, or otherwise take action pursuant to a vote of such holders, separately from holders of another such series: Provided, That “series of securities” or “series” shall not include any series of securities issuable under an indenture if all such series rank equally and are wholly unsecured.
The specification of percentages in paragraphs (5) to (9), inclusive, of this subsection shall not be construed as indicating that the ownership of such percentages of the securities of a person is or is not necessary or sufficient to constitute direct or indirect control for the purposes of paragraph (3) or (7) of this subsection.
For the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), (8), and (9) of this subsection—
(A)
 the terms “security” and “securities” shall include only such securities as are generally known as corporate securities, but shall not include any note or other evidence of indebtedness issued to evidence an obligation to repay moneys lent to a person by one or more banks, trust companies, or banking firms, or any certificate of interest or participation in any such note or evidence of indebtedness;

(B)
 an obligation shall be deemed to be in default when a default in payment of principal shall have continued for thirty days or more, and shall not have been cured; and

(C)
 the indenture trustee shall not be deemed the owner or holder of (i) any security which it holds as collateral security (as trustee or otherwise) for any obligation which is not in default as above defined, or (ii) any security which it holds as collateral security under the indenture to be qualified, irrespective of any default thereunder, or (iii) any security which it holds as agent for collection, or as custodian, escrow agent or depositary, or in any similar representative capacity.

For the purposes of this subsection, the term “underwriter” when used with reference to an obligor upon the indenture securities means every person who, within one year prior to the time as of which the determination is made, was an underwriter of any security of such obligor outstanding at the time of the determination.
Except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any indenture security, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment, the indenture trustee shall not be required to resign as provided by this subsection if such trustee shall have sustained the burden of proving, on application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that—
(i)
 the default under the indenture may be cured or waived during a reasonable period and under the procedures described in such application, and

(ii)
 a stay of the trustee’s duty to resign will not be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the indenture securities. The filing of such an application shall automatically stay the performance of the duty to resign until the Commission orders otherwise.

Any resignation of an indenture trustee shall become effective only upon the appointment of a successor trustee and such successor’s acceptance of such an appointment.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77jjj -  Eligibility and disqualification of trustee 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines rules for selecting and maintaining trustees under an indenture, which is a contract between a bond issuer and bondholders. Key points include:

1. At least one trustee must be a corporation operating under U.S. law or approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This trustee must be authorized to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to government oversight. The SEC may also allow a foreign corporation to act as a trustee under certain circumstances.

2. The trustee must maintain a certain level of combined capital and surplus, not less than $150,000.

3. If there are co-trustees, the institutional trustee is primarily responsible for duties unless they are unqualified or incompetent to perform certain acts, in which case the co-trustees step in.

4. If the trustee acquires a conflicting interest (e.g., they also serve as trustee for another bond issuer or have a substantial financial stake in the bond issuer), they must address this conflict within 90 days or resign. If this doesn't occur, bondholders can take legal action to remove the trustee and appoint a successor.

5. The trustee or any of its directors or officers can't also be an officer, director, or employee of the bond issuer or an underwriter for the bond issuer.

In summary, this section of the law aims to ensure that trustees are reliable, financially stable, and free from conflicts of interest that could undermine their duty to protect bondholders' interests.

                        U.S. Code 



                        Notes 




prev | next





(a) Trustee as creditor of obligorSubject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, if the indenture trustee shall be, or shall become, a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured, of an obligor upon the indenture securities, within three months prior to a default as defined in the last paragraph of this subsection, or subsequent to such a default, then, unless and until such default shall be cured, such trustee shall set apart and hold in a special account for the benefit of the trustee individually and the indenture security holders—
(1)
 an amount equal to any and all reductions in the amount due and owing upon any claim as such creditor in respect of principal or interest, effected after the beginning of such three months’ period and valid as against such obligor and its other creditors, except any such reduction resulting from the receipt or disposition of any property described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, or from the exercise of any right of setoff which the trustee could have exercised if a petition in bankruptcy had been filed by or against such obligor upon the date of such default; and

(2)
 all property received in respect of any claim as such creditor, either as security therefor, or in satisfaction or composition thereof, or otherwise, after the beginning of such three months’ period, or an amount equal to the proceeds of any such property, if disposed of, subject, however, to the rights, if any, of such obligor and its other creditors in such property or such proceeds.

Nothing herein contained shall affect the right of the indenture trustee—
(A)
 to retain for its own account (i) payments made on account of any such claim by any person (other than such obligor) who is liable thereon, and (ii) the proceeds of the bona fide sale of any such claim by the trustee to a third person, and (iii) distributions made in cash, securities, or other property in respect of claims filed against such obligor in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law;

(B)
 to realize, for its own account, upon any property held by it as security for any such claim, if such property was so held prior to the beginning of such three months’ period;

(C)
 to realize, for its own account, but only to the extent of the claim hereinafter mentioned, upon any property held by it as security for any such claim, if such claim was created after the beginning of such three months’ period and such property was received as security therefor simultaneously with the creation thereof, and if the trustee shall sustain the burden of proving that at the time such property was so received the trustee had no reasonable cause to believe that a default as defined in the last paragraph of this subsection would occur within three months; or

(D)
 to receive payment on any claim referred to in paragraph (B) or (C) of this subsection, against the release of any property held as security for such claim as provided in said paragraph (B) or (C), as the case may be, to the extent of the fair value of such property.

For the purposes of paragraphs (B), (C), and (D) of this subsection, property substituted after the beginning of such three months’ period for property held as security at the time of such substitution shall, to the extent of the fair value of the property released, have the same status as the property released, and, to the extent that any claim referred to in any of such paragraphs is created in renewal of or in substitution for or for the purpose of repaying or refunding any preexisting claim of the indenture trustee as such creditor, such claim shall have the same status as such preexisting claim.
If the trustee shall be required to account, the funds and property held in such special account and the proceeds thereof shall be apportioned between the trustee and the indenture security holders in such manner that the trustee and the indenture security holders realize, as a result of payments from such special account and payments of dividends on claims filed against such obligor in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, the same percentage of their respective claims, figured before crediting to the claim of the trustee anything on account of the receipt by it from such obligor of the funds and property in such special account and before crediting to the respective claims of the trustee and the indenture security holders dividends on claims filed against such obligor in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, but after crediting thereon receipts on account of the indebtedness represented by their respective claims from all sources other than from such dividends and from the funds and property so held in such special account. As used in this paragraph, with respect to any claim, the term “dividends” shall include any distribution with respect to such claim, in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, whether such distribution is made in cash, securities, or other property, but shall not include any such distribution with respect to the secured portion, if any, of such claim. The court in which such bankruptcy, receivership, or proceeding for reorganization is pending shall have jurisdiction (i) to apportion between the indenture trustee and the indenture security holders, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the funds and property held in such special account and the proceeds thereof, or (ii) in lieu of such apportionment, in whole or in part, to give to the provisions of this paragraph due consideration in determining the fairness of the distributions to be made to the indenture trustee and the indenture security holders with respect to their respective claims, in which event it shall not be necessary to liquidate or to appraise the value of any securities or other property held in such special account or as security for any such claim, or to make a specific allocation of such distributions as between the secured and unsecured portions of such claims, or otherwise to apply the provisions of this paragraph as a mathematical formula.
Any indenture trustee who has resigned or been removed after the beginning of such three months’ period shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection as though such resignation or removal had not occurred. Any indenture trustee who has resigned or been removed prior to the beginning of such three months’ period shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection if and only if the following conditions exist—
(i)
 the receipt of property or reduction of claim which would have given rise to the obligation to account, if such indenture trustee had continued as trustee, occurred after the beginning of such three months’ period; and

(ii)
 such receipt of property or reduction of claim occurred within three months after such resignation or removal.

As used in this subsection, the term “default” means any failure to make payment in full of principal or interest, when and as the same becomes due and payable, under any indenture which has been qualified under this subchapter, and under which the indenture trustee is trustee and the person of whom the indenture trustee is directly or indirectly a creditor is an obligor; and the term “indenture security holder” means all holders of securities outstanding under any such indenture under which any such default exists. In any case commenced under the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, or any amendment thereto enacted prior to November 6, 1978, all references to periods of three months shall be deemed to be references to periods of four months.

(b) Exclusion of creditor relationship arising from specified classesThe indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions excluding from the operation of subsection (a) of this section a creditor relationship arising from—
(1)
 the ownership or acquisition of securities issued under any indenture, or any security or securities having a maturity of one year or more at the time of acquisition by the indenture trustee;

(2)

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77kkk -  Preferential collection of claims against obligor 


15 U.S. Code § 77kkk is a legal provision that deals with the collection of claims against an obligor. It particularly addresses situations in which the trustee of the indenture securities is also a creditor of the obligor.

Under this law, the trustee must set apart and hold certain funds and properties in a special account for the benefit of themselves and the holders of the indenture securities. This applies if the trustee became a creditor of the obligor within three months prior to a default or anytime after such a default. 

The trustee must account for any decrease in the amount due on any claim as a creditor and any property received in relation to such claim. However, the law also provides for certain exceptions that allow the trustee to retain certain payments and properties for their own account.

The law also provides rules for how the funds and property in the special account should be distributed between the trustee and the security holders in the event of a bankruptcy or receivership.

Additionally, the law details circumstances in which a creditor relationship would not fall under the operation of this law, such as the trustee's ownership of securities with a maturity of one year or more or disbursements made in the ordinary course of business. 

In summary, this law provides guidelines for how trustees, who are also creditors of an obligor, should handle funds and property in the event of a default, and aims to ensure fairness in distribution of assets in the event of bankruptcy or receivership.

(a) Periodic filing of information by obligor with trustee

Each obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the institutional trustee thereunder at stated intervals of not more than six months, and at such other times as such trustee may request in writing, all information in the possession or control of such obligor, or of any of its paying agents, as to the names and addresses of the indenture security holders, and requiring such trustee to preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all such information so furnished to it or received by it in the capacity of paying agent.


(b) Access of information to security holdersWithin five business days after the receipt by the institutional trustee of a written application by any three or more indenture security holders stating that the applicants desire to communicate with other indenture security holders with respect to their rights under such indenture or under the indenture securities, and accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, and by reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned an indenture security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, such institutional trustee shall, at its election, either—
(1)
 afford to such applicants access to all information so furnished to or received by such trustee; or

(2)
 inform such applicants as to the approximate number of indenture security holders according to the most recent information so furnished to or received by such trustee, and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such indenture security holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.

If such trustee shall elect not to afford to such applicants access to such information, such trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to all such indenture security holders copies of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to such trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of such mailing, unless within five days after such tender, such trustee shall mail to such applicants, and file with the Commission together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of such trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the indenture security holders or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. After opportunity for hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, the Commission may, and if demanded by such trustee or by such applicants shall, enter an order either sustaining one or more of such objections or refusing to sustain any of them. If the Commission shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections, or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all objections so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring, such trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such indenture security holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender.

(c) Disclosure of information deemed not violative of any law

The disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the indenture security holders in accordance with the provisions of this section, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, shall not be deemed to be a violation of any existing law, or of any law hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to this section, nor shall such trustee be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under subsection (b) of this section.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77lll -  Bondholders’ lists 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the requirements for the sharing of information between an obligor (the issuer of a bond or other debt security) and the institutional trustee. The obligor is required to provide the trustee with information about the bondholders, including their names and addresses, every six months or more frequently if the trustee requests it.

If three or more bondholders wish to communicate with other bondholders about their rights, they can apply to the trustee to access this information. The trustee can choose to either provide the bondholders with the information, or inform them of the number of bondholders and the cost of mailing them the proposed communication. If the trustee refuses to provide the information, they must mail the proposed communication to all bondholders, unless they believe doing so would be against the bondholders’ best interests or violate the law.

The trustee is not considered to be violating any law by disclosing the bondholders’ information as described in this section. They are also not held accountable for mailing any material upon request under this section.

This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1939 and was last amended in 1990. The amendments made in 1990 included minor changes to the wording of the section. The functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is responsible for enforcing this law, were transferred to the Chairman of the Commission in 1950.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77mmm -  Reports by indenture trustee 


This U.S. law, part of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, mandates that the indenture trustee (typically a bank or similar financial institution that holds and manages a bond issuer's assets on behalf of the bondholders) must send a report to the indenture security holders (the bondholders) on a yearly basis, detailing any changes or notable events concerning their obligations or the bond securities within the past 12 months.

The report must disclose any changes to the trustee's qualifications under the law, any changes in certain relationships, the nature and amount of any unpaid advances made by the trustee, debt owed to the trustee by the bond issuer, changes to property in the trustee's possession, any releases or substitutions of property under the indenture's lien, additional issues of indenture securities, and any actions taken by the trustee which affects the securities or the trust estate.

Additionally, the report must also detail the release or substitution of property subject to the lien of the indenture if its value is greater than 10% of the bond securities' principal amount, and any advances made by the trustee if they exceed 10% of the bond securities' principal amount.

This report must be mailed to all registered bondholders and those who have given their addresses to the trustee in the past two years. A copy of the report must also be filed with any stock exchange where the bond securities are listed and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Essentially, this law ensures transparency and accountability on the part of the trustee, meaning the bondholders are kept informed about changes affecting their investments. It's a bit like a yearly financial health check-up for the bond securities they hold.

The rules and regulations prescribed under this subsection shall be such as are necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, having due regard to the types of indentures, and the nature of the business of the class of obligors affected thereby, and the amount of indenture securities outstanding under such indentures, and, in the case of any such rules and regulations prescribed after the indentures to which they apply have been qualified under this subchapter, the additional expense, if any, of complying with such rules and regulations. Such rules and regulations may be prescribed either before or after qualification becomes effective as to any such indenture.

(b) Evidence of recording of indentureIf the indenture to be qualified is or is to be secured by the mortgage or pledge of property, the obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee—
(1)
 promptly after the execution and delivery of the indenture, an opinion of counsel (who may be of counsel for such obligor) either stating that in the opinion of such counsel the indenture has been properly recorded and filed so as to make effective the lien intended to be created thereby, and reciting the details of such action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary to make such lien effective; and

(2)
 at least annually after the execution and delivery of the indenture, an opinion of counsel (who may be of counsel for such obligor) either stating that in the opinion of such counsel such action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording, and refiling of the indenture as is necessary to maintain the lien of such indenture, and reciting the details of such action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary to maintain such lien.


(c) Evidence of compliance with conditions precedentThe obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee evidence of compliance with the conditions precedent, if any, provided for in the indenture (including any covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent) which relate to the authentication and delivery of the indenture securities, to the release or the release and substitution of property subject to the lien of the indenture, to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, or to any other action to be taken by the indenture trustee at the request or upon the application of such obligor. Such evidence shall consist of the following:
(1)
 certificates or opinions made by officers of such obligor who are specified in the indenture, stating that such conditions precedent have been complied with;

(2)
 an opinion of counsel (who may be of counsel for such obligor) stating that in his opinion such conditions precedent have been complied with; and

(3)
 in the case of conditions precedent compliance with which is subject to verification by accountants (such as conditions with respect to the preservation of specified ratios, the amount of net quick assets, negative-pledge clauses, and other similar specific conditions), a certificate or opinion of an accountant, who, in the case of any such conditions precedent to the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, and not otherwise, shall be an independent public accountant selected or approved by the indenture trustee in the exercise of reasonable care, if the aggregate principal amount of such indenture securities and of other indenture securities authenticated and delivered since the commencement of the then current calendar year (other than those with respect to which a certificate or opinion of an accountant is not required, or with respect to which a certificate or opinion of an independent public accountant has previously been furnished) is 10 per centum or more of the aggregate amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding; but no certificate or opinion need be made by any person other than an officer or employee of such obligor who is specified in the indenture, as to (A) dates or periods not covered by annual reports required to be filed by the obligor, in the case of conditions precedent which depend upon a state of facts as of a date or dates or for a period or periods different from that required to be covered by such annual reports, or (B) the amount and value of property additions, except as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (d), or (C) the adequacy of depreciation, maintenance, or repairs.


(d) Certificates of fair valueIf the indenture to be qualified is or is to be secured by the mortgage or pledge of property or securities, the obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee a certificate or opinion of an engineer, appraiser, or other expert as to the fair value—
(1)
 of any property or securities to be released from the lien of the indenture, which certificate or opinion shall state that in the opinion of the person making the same the proposed release will not impair the security under such indenture in contravention of the provisions thereof, and requiring further that such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert, if the fair value of such property or securities and of all other property or securities released since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates or opinions required by this paragraph, is 10 per centum or more of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding; but such a certificate or opinion of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert shall not be required in the case of any release of property or securities, if the fair value thereof as set forth in the certificate or opinion required by this paragraph is less than $25,000 or less than 1 per centum of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding;

(2)
 to such obligor of any securities (other than indenture securities and securities secured by a lien prior to the lien of the indenture upon property subject to the lien of the indenture), the deposit of which with the trustee is to be made the basis for the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, the withdrawal of cash constituting a part of the trust estate or the release of property or securities subject to the lien of the indenture, and requiring further that if the fair value to such obligor of such securities and of all other such securities made the basis of any such authentication and delivery, withdrawal, or release since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates or opinions required by this paragraph, is 10 per centum or more of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding, such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert and, in the case of the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, shall cover the fair value to such obligor of all other such securities so deposited since the commencement of the current calendar year as to which a certificate or opinion of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert has not previously been furnished; but such a certificate of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert shall not be required with respect to any securities so deposited, if the fair value thereof to such obligor as set forth in the certificate or opinion required by this paragraph is less than $25,000 or less than 1 per centum of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding; and

(3) to such obligor of any property the subjection of which to the lien of the indenture is to be made the basis for the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, the withdrawal of cash constituting a part of the trust estate, or the release of property or securities subject to the lien of the indenture, and requiring further that if
(A)
 within six months prior to the date of acquisition thereof by such obligor, such property has been used or operated, by a person or persons other than such obligor, in a business similar to that in which it has been or is to be used or operated by such obligor, and

(B)
 the fair value to such obligor of such property as set forth in such certificate or opinion is not less than $25,000 and not less than 1 per centum of the aggregate principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding,

such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert and, in the case of the authentication and delivery of indenture securities, shall cover the fair value to the obligor of any property so used or operated which has been so subjected to the lien of the indenture since the commencement of the then current calendar year, and as to which a certificate or opinion of an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert has not previously been furnished.

The indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that such provision is excluded) to provide that any such certificate or opinion may be made by an officer or employee of the obligor upon the indenture securities who is duly authorized to make such certificate or opinion by the obligor from time to time, except in cases in which this subsection requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent person. In such cases, such certificate or opinion shall be made by an independent engineer, appraiser, or other expert selected or approved by the indenture trustee in the exercise of reasonable care.

(e) Recitals as to basis of certificate or opinion

Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in the indenture (other than certificates provided pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section) shall include (1) a statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition; (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based; (3) a statement that, in the opinion of such person, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition or covenant has been complied with.


(f) Parties may provide for additional evidence

Nothing in this section shall be construed either as requiring the inclusion in the indenture to be qualified of provisions that the obligor upon the indenture securities shall furnish to the indenture trustee any other evidence of compliance with the conditions and covenants provided for in the indenture than the evidence specified in this section, or as preventing the inclusion of such provisions in such indenture, if the parties so agree.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77nnn -  Reports by obligor; evidence of compliance with indenture provisions 


15 U.S. Code § 77nnn, part of the United States Code, details the reporting requirements for any person who is an obligor under an indenture, a legal contract that outlines the terms of a bond or loan. Key requirements include:

- Obligors must file copies of annual reports and other relevant documents with the indenture trustee. These documents should detail the obligor's compliance with covenants and conditions outlined in the indenture. In certain cases, obligors must also file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
- Obligors are required to periodically provide the indenture trustee and bondholders with summaries of any information, documents, and reports required to be filed.
- Annually, the obligor must provide the indenture trustee with a certificate from a principal executive, financial or accounting officer attesting to the obligor's compliance with the indenture's conditions and covenants.
- Obligors must provide the indenture trustee with evidence of compliance with conditions precedent outlined in the indenture. This evidence can take the form of certificates or opinions made by specified officers of the obligor, opinions of counsel, or certificates or opinions of an independent public accountant.
- If the indenture is secured by a mortgage or pledge of property, the obligor must provide the indenture trustee with a certificate or opinion of the fair value of any property or securities to be released from the lien of the indenture.

These regulations are designed to protect investors and ensure transparency in the securities market.

                        U.S. Code 



                        Notes 




prev | next





(a) Duties prior to defaultThe indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to provide that, prior to default (as such term is defined in such indenture)—
(1)
 the indenture trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties as are specifically set out in such indenture; and

(2)
 the indenture trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, in the absence of bad faith on the part of such trustee, upon certificates or opinions conforming to the requirements of the indenture;

but the indenture trustee shall examine the evidence furnished to it pursuant to section 77nnn of this title to determine whether or not such evidence conforms to the requirements of the indenture.

(b) Notice of defaults

The indenture trustee shall give to the indenture security holders, in the manner and to the extent provided in subsection (c) of section 77mmm of this title, notice of all defaults known to the trustee, within ninety days after the occurrence thereof: Provided, That such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that such provision is excluded) to provide that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any indenture security, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment, the trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors and/or responsible officers, of the trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the indenture security holders.


(c) Duties of the trustee in case of default

The indenture trustee shall exercise in case of default (as such term is defined in such indenture) such of the rights and powers vested in it by such indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.


(d) Responsibility of the trusteeThe indenture to be qualified shall not contain any provisions relieving the indenture trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that—
(1)
 such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain the provisions authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section;

(2)
 such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions protecting the indenture trustee from liability for any error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer or officers of such trustee, unless it shall be proved that such trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(3)
 such indenture shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions protecting the indenture trustee with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the indenture securities at the time outstanding (determined as provided in subsection (a) of section 77ppp of this title) relating to the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to such trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon such trustee, under such indenture.


(e) Undertaking for costs

The indenture to be qualified shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions to the effect that all parties thereto, including the indenture security holders, agree that the court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under such indenture, or in any suit against the trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant: Provided, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any suit instituted by such trustee, to any suit instituted by any indenture security holder, or group of indenture security holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10 per centum in principal amount of the indenture securities outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any indenture security holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77ooo -  Duties and responsibility of the trustee 


This section of the U.S. Code (15 U.S. Code § 77ooo) provides various directives related to the duties and responsibilities of the trustee in an indenture, which is a legal contract describing the terms of a bond or loan.

Preceding a default, the trustee is not liable except for the performance of duties specifically outlined in the indenture (a). The trustee may rely on certificates and opinions conforming to the requirements of the indenture, assuming there is no bad faith, yet is required to examine any evidence according to section 77nnn (a).

In the case of a default, the trustee is required to notify the indenture security holders within ninety days (b). However, except in cases of non-payment of principal, interest, or sinking funds, the trustee has the right to withhold such notice if they determine it is in the best interests of the security holders (b).

In the event of a default, the trustee is expected to exercise rights and powers as outlined in the indenture with the care and skill of a prudent man (c).

The indenture cannot relieve the trustee from liability due to negligence or willful misconduct but can protect the trustee from liability for an error of judgment made in good faith (d). The trustee is also protected when acting in good faith in accordance with the direction of a majority of the indenture securities holders (d).

The court may require an undertaking to pay the costs of any suit related to right or remedy enforcement, or actions taken by the trustee, and may assess reasonable costs and attorney fees against any party (e). However, this does not apply to suits instituted by the trustee or indenture security holders holding more than 10% of the outstanding securities, or suits for enforcement of payment of principal or interest (e).

This section was amended in 1990 (Pub. L. 101–550), changing language to deem the indenture to automatically contain certain provisions unless expressly excluded.

                        U.S. Code 



                        Notes 




prev | next





(a) Directions and waivers by bondholdersThe indenture to be qualified—
(1)
 shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions authorizing the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the indenture securities or if expressly specified in such indenture, of any series of securities at the time outstanding (A) to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to such trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon such trustee, under such indenture, or (B) on behalf of the holders of all such indenture securities, to consent to the waiver of any past default and its consequences; or

(2)
 may contain provisions authorizing the holders of not less than 75 per centum in principal amount of the indenture securities or if expressly specified in such indenture, of any series of securities at the time outstanding to consent on behalf of the holders of all such indenture securities to the postponement of any interest payment for a period not exceeding three years from its due date.

For the purposes of this subsection and paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of section 77ooo of this title, in determining whether the holders of the required principal amount of indenture securities have concurred in any such direction or consent, indenture securities owned by any obligor upon the indenture securities, or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with any such obligor, shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the indenture trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction or consent, only indenture securities which such trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

(b) Prohibition of impairment of holder’s right to paymentNotwithstanding any other provision of the indenture to be qualified, the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder, except—
(1)
 as to a postponement of an interest payment consented to as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (a);

(2)
 that such indenture may contain provisions limiting or denying the right of any such holder to institute any such suit, if and to the extent that the institution or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under applicable law, result in the surrender, impairment, waiver, or loss of the lien of such indenture upon any property subject to such lien; and

(3)
 that the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security shall not be deemed to be impaired or affected by any change occurring by the application of section 5803 of title 12 to any indenture security.


(c) Record date

The obligor upon any indenture qualified under this subchapter may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of indenture security holders entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted by subsection (a) of this section. Unless the indenture provides otherwise, such record date shall be the later of 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of holders furnished to the trustee pursuant to section 77lll of this title prior to such solicitation.


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 316, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1172; amended Pub. L. 101–550, title IV, § 415, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2731; Pub. L. 117–103, div. U, § 108, Mar. 15, 2022, 136 Stat. 832.)

(1) inserted “shall automatically be deemed (unless it is expressly provided therein that any such provision is excluded) to contain provisions” before “authorizing the holders” and “or if expressly specified in such indenture, of any series of securities” after “principal amount of the indenture securities”, and in par. (2) inserted “may contain provisions” before “authorizing the holders” and “or if expressly specified in such indenture, of any series of securities” after “principal amount of the indenture securities”.
Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 101–550, § 415(5), which directed the substitution of “of the indenture to be qualified” for “thereof”, was executed by making the substitution for “thereof” the first time appearing, as the probable intent of Congress.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77ppp -  Directions and waivers by bondholders; prohibition of impairment of holder’s right to payment; record date 


This U.S. federal law, 15 U.S. Code § 77ppp, outlines the permissions and restrictions related to bondholder rights, particularly in relation to debt securities. Here are the key points:

1. Directions and Waivers by Bondholders (Section a): This section states that the indenture, or the formal agreement between a bond issuer and bondholders, must include certain provisions unless explicitly stated otherwise. For instance, holders of a majority of the bond's principal amount can direct the trustee's actions or consent to waive past defaults. Additionally, if 75% of bondholders agree, they can consent to delay an interest payment for up to three years.

2. Prohibition of Impairment of Holder’s Right to Payment (Section b): This section safeguards the rights of bondholders to receive their principal and interest payments on the due dates, or to sue for enforcement of these payments. This right cannot be impaired or affected without the consent of the bondholder, with a few exceptions, such as consenting to delay an interest payment, or in circumstances where a suit would result in the loss of the lien of such indenture.

3. Record Date (Section c): The issuer can set a record date to determine who the bondholders are entitled to vote or consent to any action authorized by Section a. Unless stated otherwise in the indenture, the record date is either 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the date of the most recent list of holders furnished to the trustee.

The law has been amended a few times since its inception in 1933, most recently in 2022, to include additional stipulations and exceptions. This law essentially ensures that bondholders' rights are protected and they have a say in significant decisions related to the bonds they hold.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77qqq -  Special powers of trustee; duties of paying agents 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the duties of a trustee and paying agent in the case of a default in payment of the principal or interest on any indenture security. 

The trustee is authorized to recover the entire unpaid amount of the principal and interest in case of such a default. They are also authorized to file necessary claims and documents to have their claims and those of the indenture security holders allowed in judicial proceedings related to the obligor, its creditors, or its property.

The paying agent is required to hold all funds intended for the payment of the principal or interest on the indenture securities in trust for the benefit of the indenture security holders or the trustee. They are also required to notify the trustee of any default by the obligor in making such payments.

The amendments in 1990 and 2010 mainly made changes in language and phrasing but did not alter the substance of the section. The effective date of the 2010 amendment was one day after July 21, 2010.

(a) Imposed duties to control

If any provision of the indenture to be qualified limits, qualifies, or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of subsection (c) of this section, the imposed duties shall control.


(b) Additional provisions

The indenture to be qualified may contain, in addition to provisions specifically authorized under this subchapter to be included therein, any other provisions the inclusion of which is not in contravention of any provision of this subchapter.


(c) Provisions governing qualified indentures

The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not be deemed to effect the inclusion (by retroactive amendment or otherwise) in the text of any indenture heretofore qualified of any of the optional provisions contemplated by section 77jjj(b)(1), 77kkk(b), 77nnn(d), 77ooo(a), 77ooo(b), 77ooo(d), 77ooo(e), or 77ppp(a)(1) of this title.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77rrr -  Effect of prescribed indenture provisions 


This section of the U.S. Code pertains to the terms and conditions of a financial agreement, known as an indenture. The language in the law is quite technical, but in layman's terms:

(a) The code states that if a provision in an indenture (a legal contract between a bond issuer and bondholders) conflicts or qualifies with the duties legally imposed by the code, the legally imposed duties will take precedence.

(b) The indenture may include additional provisions, as long as they do not violate any part of this legal code.

(c) Any duties imposed by certain sections of this title (specifically sections 77jjj through 77qqq) must be included in every qualified indenture, even if they are not physically present in the indenture document. The law retroactively applies these duties to previously qualified indentures and will apply them to future qualified indentures. However, this does not mean that any optional provisions from other law sections are automatically included in the indenture.

In 1990, the law was revised. The new amendment changed the wording in sub-section (a) and added a new sub-section (c). For sub-section (a), the new wording emphasized that legally imposed duties will control if there is any conflict with the provisions contained within the indenture. For the new sub-section (c), it made it clear that certain legal duties must be included and govern every qualified indenture. 

In a nutshell, this law is about how certain legal requirements take precedence over the terms and conditions set within a financial contract. If you think of the indenture as the rules of a board game, this law is stating that certain federal rules always have to be followed, no matter what the game's rules might say.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77sss -  Rules, regulations, and orders 


This section of the U.S. Code grants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the authority to create, modify, and enforce rules and regulations that it deems necessary for the protection of investors or in the public interest. The rules and regulations may pertain to financial and technical definitions, calculation methods for securities, and the way information should be presented in documents filed with the SEC. 

Additionally, these rules and regulations become effective immediately upon publication, unless a later date is specified. The SEC also has the power to classify different types of securities, persons, and other matters within its jurisdiction and may prescribe different requirements for each category.

This Section also provides an exemption from liability for acts performed in good faith in accordance with the SEC's rules and regulations, even if these are later amended or deemed invalid.

The section was last amended in 1998 to replace "the Federal Register Act" with "chapter 15 of title 44".

In essence, this section serves as the legal basis for the SEC's regulatory power in the realm of securities and investments. It underlines the SEC's role in ensuring the fairness, transparency, and integrity of the securities market for the protection of investors.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77ttt -  Hearings by Commission 


This section of the U.S. Code states that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the authority to hold public hearings. These hearings can be led by the Commission itself, any member of the Commission, or any officer appointed by the Commission. Records of these hearings must be kept. 

The law also references an executive transfer of functions that occurred in 1950, which moved the majority of the SEC's responsibilities to the Chairman of the Commission. However, it does not provide any specifics about what exceptions were made in this transfer. 

In simpler terms, this regulation is about how the SEC can hold hearings, who can be in charge of them, and the importance of keeping records. It also refers to a shift in power within the SEC that occurred in the mid-20th century.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77uuu -  Special powers of the Commission 


This section of the U.S. Code outlines the special powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for enforcement and investigation under the Securities Act. 

The SEC or any designated member can administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel attendance, take evidence and require production of relevant materials. This can be done anywhere in the U.S. or its territories. The Commission also has the powers with respect to investigations, hearings, enforcement of, and offenses and violations under the subchapter and rules, regulations, and orders under its authority.

Various federal entities like the Treasury Department, Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can make available to the SEC any reports, records, or information they have with respect to trustees or prospective trustees under indentures qualified or to be qualified under this subchapter. 

The SEC is also empowered to investigate prospective trustees to determine their qualification. The investigation is limited to evaluating whether the prospective trustee is qualified to act as trustee and requiring the inclusion of certain information in the registration statement or application.

The SEC also has the power to appoint and compensate employees required to carry out its functions and to lease and allocate real property necessary for carrying out its functions.

In a nutshell, this section provides the SEC with broad investigatory and enforcement powers to regulate and oversee securities transactions, enforce securities laws, and regulate securities professionals. It also provides for cooperation and information sharing between the SEC and other federal entities. This is to ensure the integrity of the securities market and protect investors.

Orders of the Commission under this subchapter (including orders pursuant to the provisions of sections 77eee(b) and 77ggg(c) of this title) shall be subject to review in the same manner, upon the same conditions, and to the same extent, as provided in section 9 of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77i], with respect to orders of the Commission under such Act.


(b) Jurisdiction of offenses and suits

Jurisdiction of offenses and violations under, and jurisdiction and venue of suits and actions brought to enforce any liability or duty created by, this subchapter, or any rules or regulations or orders prescribed under the authority thereof, shall be as provided in section 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77v(a)].


(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 322, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1175; amended Pub. L. 101–550, title IV, § 418, Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2732.)

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77vvv -  Judicial review 


This section of the U.S. Code, 15 U.S.C. § 77vvv, pertains to the judicial review of orders from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Essentially, it allows for the review of SEC orders in the same manner as provided by the Securities Act of 1933. It also gives jurisdiction for any offenses, violations, suits, and actions brought to enforce liabilities or duties created by this subchapter or any related rules, regulations, or orders.

To put it in simpler terms, this law is about making sure SEC decisions can be checked by the courts, keeping the power of the commission in check. If the SEC were to make an order that someone thinks is wrong, this law allows them to challenge that order in court. The section also states that legal actions to enforce the rules of this subchapter are subject to the same jurisdiction and venue provisions as provided in the Securities Act of 1933.

The only amendment to it was made in 1990, where the phrase “or duty” was added after “any liability”. This implies that not only are liabilities enforceable by this statute, but so are duties. 

Essentially, it ensures that SEC orders can be reviewed and that offenses or violations of the statute, its rules, or its regulations can be legally pursued. It is a part of the checks and balances for the SEC's power.

(a)
 Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed with the Commission pursuant to any provisions of this subchapter, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or who shall omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading or of such omission) who, in reliance upon such statement or omission, shall have purchased or sold a security issued under the indenture to which such application, report, or document relates, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading or of such omission. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against either party litigant, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the suit or defense. No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued.

(b)
 The rights and remedies provided by this subchapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], or otherwise at law or in equity; but no person permitted to maintain a suit for damages under the provisions of this subchapter shall recover, through satisfaction of judgment in one or more actions, a total amount in excess of his actual damages on account of the act complained of.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77www -  Liability for misleading statements 


This section of the U.S. Code sets out the liability for any person who makes or causes to be made a false or misleading statement in any document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or who omits a crucial fact from such a document. If a person purchases or sells a security based on that false or misleading statement, or omission, the person who made or caused the misleading statement or omission can be held liable for any damages caused by the transaction, unless they can prove they acted in good faith and did not know the statement was false or misleading. 

The person seeking to enforce such liability can sue in any court of competent jurisdiction, but the court may require an undertaking for the payment of the suit's costs. The action must be brought within one year after discovering the facts that constitute the cause of action and within three years after the cause of action accrued.

These rules are in addition to any other rights and remedies that exist under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any other law or equity. The person can recover the total amount of actual damages caused by the act, but not more.

In 2010, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was excluded from the acts that these rules reinforce. The effective date of this amendment was one day after July 21, 2010. The functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission, barring some exceptions, were transferred to the Chairman of the Commission as per the Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77xxx -  Unlawful representations 


This section makes it illegal for any individual, while offering, selling or issuing any security, to imply or represent in any way that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has in some manner approved or endorsed any security, trustee, indenture, or transaction. The law prohibits implying that the Commission's action or non-action in administering this law indicates its approval or validation of any statement or report filed with or examined by the SEC. 

This legislation was added in 1939 and later amended in 1954 to include the offering of securities in addition to selling and issuing of them. 

In a nutshell, this law serves as a reminder that just because the SEC has not taken action against a security or transaction, it should not be interpreted as an endorsement or approval of that security or transaction.

This section of the U.S. Code states that, unless otherwise specified, nothing in this subchapter (which relates to the regulation of investment trusts and investment companies) should interfere with the existing powers and duties of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It means that the SEC still maintains its authority over any person, security, or contract as laid out in these acts.

Moreover, it states that this subchapter does not impact the rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities of any person under these acts. Additionally, it does not affect the jurisdiction of any other commission, board, agency, or officer of the U.S. or of any state or political subdivision thereof, over any person or security, as long as such jurisdiction does not conflict with any provision of this subchapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

In 2010, the text was amended to remove a reference to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, with the amendment coming into effect the day after July 21, 2010. 

In layman's terms, this section is essentially stating that the regulations it lays out should not interfere with any existing laws or the authority of other regulatory bodies, as long as there is no conflict with its provisions.

##  15 U.S. Code § 77aaaa -  Contrary stipulations void 







                        U.S. Code

Any condition, stipulation, or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this subchapter or with any rule, regulation, or order thereunder shall be void.

(May 27, 1933, ch. 38, title III, § 327, as added Aug. 3, 1939, ch. 411, 53 Stat. 1177.)












### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77aaaa -  Contrary stipulations void 


This section of the U.S. Code, enacted in 1933 and modified in 1939, states that any agreement, contract, or condition that requires a person to forego or waive compliance with any part of this subchapter, or with any rule, regulation, or order under it, is null and void. In layman's terms, it means you can't legally agree to ignore or bypass the rules set by this law. 

Significantly, this law is part of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, which is designed to protect the interests of individual investors in bonds and debentures, and sets strict standards for the conduct of trustees and the terms of trust agreements. 

This clause specifically ensures that no one can be forced or tricked into giving up the protections offered by the Act. Any attempts to do so would be deemed legally invalid. 

It's a bit like a safety net that ensures the rules of the game can't be changed mid-play. Or think of it like a seatbelt law - you can't sign a contract agreeing not to wear your seatbelt, because that would be against the law. The same principle applies here: you can't waive your rights under this act, regardless of any contracts or agreements you may have signed.

If any provision of this subchapter or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of the subchapter and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid shall not be affected thereby.

### commentary on ##  15 U.S. Code § 77bbbb -  Separability 


This section of the U.S. Code pertains to the "separability" of the provisions within this subchapter. Essentially, it states that if any specific provision within the subchapter is deemed invalid or not applicable to a certain person or situation, that does not affect or invalidate the rest of the subchapter. The rest of the subchapter's provisions remain applicable and valid to all other persons or circumstances not specifically addressed in the invalidated provision. This law was added to this subchapter in 1939.
